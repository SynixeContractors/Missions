Surveillance shows almost every town to be heavily guarded, along with enemy technicals patrolling the area so plan your routes accordingly. Most importantly, their is one singular road leading in and out of the takistani mountains. With this being the enemy's only way to get supplies in and out, it is sure to be heavily fortified.

The helicopter was on a flight path that took it over northern Chernarus.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>Recently, Chernarus has had an outbreak of rioting, looting, and violence. A significant portion of Chernarus' rural north has devolved into anarchy and chaos.

Please refer to the HAZARDS briefing for additional information.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>Astra has provided us the minimum necessary equipment to safely locate and scan the samples. Most importantly, Astra has supplied us with an ED-1E drone which we will have to use to scan the research samples. The drone is a vital piece of equipment, as it contains the sampling laser necessary to gather any useful data on the research samples. Please refer to the HAZARDS briefing for more info on equipment.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>Astra has used a local point of contact to insert us as close to Petrovka as possible, though we will have to start our scan of the region on foot.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>Additionally, Astra has also requested that we attempt to recover any of the missing helicopter crew or Astra security, if possible. Locating and scanning the research samples remains the primary objective, however.\n        ",
