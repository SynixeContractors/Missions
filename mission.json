With Santa's security detail gone, with eyes turned away, it was the perfect time to strike.\n\nSanta has been kidnapped. Secret demands have been made, and if they are not met, Santa's fate is uncertain.\n\nSanta's elite security team, the Special Northern Operations Wing (SNOW), have been dispatched to rescue him.
