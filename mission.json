Feeling strong in its position, North Korea decided to release the interned soldiers and boarded them on a flight to Singapore.\n\nThe weakened and isolated parliament has not yet decided on a response, but a research mission from a Dutch university has not been heard from yet. Our clients want us to recover the mission and its results. The research station was situated in the middle of the island, with accommodation being based in the towns of Tabako and Kolaka. Synixe will be inserting on boats and may have to requisition civilian transport on the island.\n\nThe island is under curfew and without access to communications.
