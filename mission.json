His security detail had gone home to spend the days following Christmas with their families, their hard work and sacrifices appreciated but no longer needed.\n\nThe world had started to forget about Santa again, until next November when the stores would switch their playlists once again.\n\nThis was exactly what the Grinch had been waiting for. With Santa's security detail gone, with eyes turned away, it was the perfect time to strike.\n\nSanta has been kidnapped. Secret demands have been made, and if they are not met, Santa's fate is uncertain.\n\nSanta's elite security team, the Special Northern Operations Wing (SNOW), have been dispatched to rescue him. Negiotiates with the likes of the Grinch will not be entertained.\n",

They are believed to be armed with a variety of weapons and explosives, and are operating under the command of the Grinch himself.\n"
