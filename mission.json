Three weeks ago, pirates attacked a Daltgreen vessel, forcing the crew to abandon it. Last week, a bomb was detonated at the Red Spring surface mine, injuring three Daltgreen workers.\n\nWe are tasked with staffing a security shift at the Blue Pearl industrial port from 0400 to 0600. We are responsible for securing the entire premises. There should be relatively few Daltgreen workers and activity during these early morning hours.\n\nThere are two Gendarmerie guard posts at either entrance to the port. There is an additional Gendarmerie guard post to the south on the road that leads to the mine. A couple of Genarmerie sentries will be patrolling the perimeter.\n\nAt this time, Daltgreen does not find it necessary for us to sweep the whole premises for bombs. Daltgreen believes they have had enough security at the port to prevent that threat so far, unlike the surface mine. The Gendarmerie and workers on site will have the ability to reach us by radio, if someting does arise.\n\nThere is an important naval shipment approaching from the east that is expected to arrive at the port at 0500 and leave by 0530. We are to see to its safe arrival and departure from the AO.\n\nDaltgreen has given us rooftop access for the sole office building at the port.

Any bombs or bomb components must be defused. Any remaining explosive material (including disarmed bombs) will need to be taken offsite and safely disposed of, as they don't want any explosive material falling into the wrong hands.

If necessary, the Daltgreen truck itself can be driven offsite and destroyed.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>Security camera footage from the previous night shows the bomb being driven on site in a Daltgreen cargo truck by a Daltgreen employee. Based on the number of the truck and the time of the incident, Daltgreen suspects their employee Theodoros Manetta was the driver. Currently, Daltgreen is unsure of his whereabouts.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>Daltgreen has tasked us with finding and detaining Theodoros Manetta. We are to search his worker place of residence at grid 044923 for any clues as to his whereabouts or his motives.
