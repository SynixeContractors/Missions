A couple of Genarmerie sentries will be patrolling the perimeter.\n\nAt this time, Daltgreen does not find it necessary for us to sweep the whole premises for bombs. Daltgreen believes they have had enough security at the port to prevent that threat so far, unlike the surface mine. The Gendarmerie and workers on site will have the ability to reach us by radio, if someting does arise.\n\nThere is an important naval shipment approaching from the east that is expected to arrive at the port at 0500 and leave by 0530.

Any bombs or bomb components must be defused. Any remaining explosive material (including disarmed bombs) will need to be taken offsite and safely disposed of, as they don't want any explosive material falling into the wrong hands.

If necessary, the Daltgreen truck itself can be driven offsite and destroyed.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>Security camera footage from the previous night shows the bomb being driven on site in a Daltgreen cargo truck by a Daltgreen employee.

Currently, Daltgreen is unsure of his whereabouts.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>Daltgreen has tasked us with finding and detaining Theodoros Manetta. We are to search his worker place of residence at grid 044923 for any clues as to his whereabouts or his motives.
