Surveillance shows almost every town to be heavily guarded, along with enemy technicals patrolling the area so plan your routes accordingly. Most importantly, their is one singular road leading in and out of the takistani mountains. With this being the enemy's only way to get supplies in and out, it is sure to be heavily fortified.

The area itself is not safe, but part of an area controlled by Slovak Separtists, but encirlced by Czech forces after a recent blitz into Separtist Territory. While this is an unsafe way to bring resources to the front, the spread and unorganized Czech forces and their need for immediate supplies, has created the need for such dire tactics and our services.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>The make of the separtist soldiers in the encircled area is mostly unknown, however caution is advised as a force, which included infantry and 3 tanks, was ambushed and forced to pull back, losing two tanks and taking heavy infantry casualties during the course of the engagement. \n            <br/>\n            <br/>Moreover, a U.S. jet supporting Czech forces by attacking possible strongholds in the area had a weapons malfuntion and missed its main target, the military base along the road. Due to the error in the targetting system, and with no eyes on the ground to confirm the location of the ordnance, it is unknown where the payload landed and what damage was caused.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>If anything on the road cannot be cleared off the road, mark down its location. However, we are expected to clear any explosive or human danger to logistics coming through the area. Anything obstacles unable to be moved by contractors will be cleared out by the Czech reservists guarding the first convoy coming through the AO.\n        ",

As tensions rise between NATO and CSAT, the U.S. is looking for ways to weaken Russian influence in Takistan by staging an attack on one of many well guarded oil pipelines -- showing the Takistani government that PMC Wagner (The entity in control of the security of most national pipelines) is unfit to do so and cannot protect their assets. \n            <br/>\n            <br/>Decimate the enemy staged in the AO and destroy the pipeline before returning to base. Due to the only feasible way for reinforcements to arrive to aid Wagner are Heliborne, AA is recommended (and can be supplied by the CIA).\n            <br/>\n            <br/>As this operation is not to be linked back to Synixe or NATO in any way, nothing that would identify Contractors is to be left behind or else the mission is a failure -- keeping the identity of the attackers unknown is more important than the objective itself.\n        ",
