Three weeks ago, pirates attacked a Daltgreen vessel, forcing the crew to abandon it. Last week, a bomb was detonated at the Red Spring surface mine, injuring three Daltgreen workers.\n\nWe are tasked with staffing a security shift at the Blue Pearl industrial port from 0400 to 0600. We are responsible for securing the entire premises. There should be relatively few Daltgreen workers and activity during these early morning hours.\n\nThere are two Gendarmerie guard posts at either entrance to the port. There is an additional Gendarmerie guard post to the south on the road that leads to the mine. A couple of Genarmerie sentries will be patrolling the perimeter.\n\nAt this time, Daltgreen does not find it necessary for us to sweep the whole premises for bombs. Daltgreen believes they have had enough security at the port to prevent that threat so far, unlike the surface mine. The Gendarmerie and workers on site will have the ability to reach us by radio, if someting does arise.\n\nThere is an important naval shipment approaching from the east that is expected to arrive at the port at 0500 and leave by 0530. We are to see to its safe arrival and departure from the AO.\n\nDaltgreen has given us rooftop access for the sole office building at the port.

While the FIA are not sure of Giorgos Elias' exact whereabouts, the AAF occupy both Oreokastro and the nearby castle.

However, the FIA has made it clear that if they find Giorgos Elias, they plan on executing him for treason. Secretly, the British government wants us to capture him alive and extract him. As such, it is vital that we reach him before the FIA does.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>When we find and secure Giorgos Elias, we are to immediately exfiltrate.

The bomb went unnoticed for most of the day until a Daltgreen employee decided to investigate a suspicious, empty Daltgreen marked vehicle.

Any bombs or bomb components must be defused. Any remaining explosive material (including disarmed bombs) will need to be taken offsite and safely disposed of, as they don't want any explosive material falling into the wrong hands. Daltgreen has advised us that the old quarry to the west at grid 020945 would be an ideal location to safely detonate any remaining explosives. If necessary, the Daltgreen truck itself can be driven offsite and destroyed.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>Security camera footage from the previous night shows the bomb being driven on site in a Daltgreen cargo truck by a Daltgreen employee. Based on the number of the truck and the time of the incident, Daltgreen suspects their employee Theodoros Manetta was the driver. Currently, Daltgreen is unsure of his whereabouts.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>Daltgreen has tasked us with finding and detaining Theodoros Manetta. We are to search his worker place of residence at grid 044923 for any clues as to his whereabouts or his motives. Daltgreen suspects he is still within the region as he has no contacts outside the company.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>Once Theodoros Manetta has been apprehended, we are to deliver him to Daltgreen at the train yard.

As of January 2nd, last year, an official treatise to end the conflict was signed by Onni Baskera (Acting leader of the Baskera Communion Party), the Russian President, and the Secretary-General of the UN. The treatise allowed Baskera to legitimately take control of the government in the eyes of the international community, officially ending the conflict.\n\nA year later, 2034, Russian regulars who entered the region for peacekeeping have ended their deployments, and the UNA who took their place are soon to end theirs. In a controversial move, the UN has hired Synixe to take over logistical operations in the area, while also allowing Synixe to open contracts with the other parties in the region, promising not instigate further conflict in the region while the peacekeeping forces focus on packing up. While open conflict has ended, the rural nature of the AO has led to it being a difficult and dangerous region to rebuild, the main reason why Synixe is operating in this region only.\n\n<font color='#e3d310'>EMPLOYER</font>\nName: UNA\nLocation: Hööpakka, Heikkola\n\nTook over for Russian Forces in the region, but steadily being drawn down as the peace keeping mission comes to an end. While at first they were in the region to protect civilian and industrial infrastructure, they rarely intervene in fights anymore unless UNA assets are already involved. While mostly drawn away from the politics of the region, UNA forces are friendly to contractors and should have their support (what little there is) from UNA forces.

Due to the large smuggling operations and terrorist acitivity in the area, they are known to set up checkpoints and raid civilian housing and indurstrial areas. Generally will not care about contractor operations in the area, and may assist on rare occasion.

In a controversial move, the UN has hired Synixe to take over logistical operations in the area, while also allowing Synixe to open contracts with the other parties in the region, promising not instigate further conflict in the region while the peacekeeping forces focus on packing up.

        "situation": "August 17th, 2029, a mass assanination attempt on the leaders of the regional government succeeded, leaving a large power vacuum that would lead to a 4 year long civil conflict between multiple armed groups. As of January 2nd, last year, an official treatise to end the conflict was signed by Onni Baskera (Acting leader of the Baskera Communion Party), the Russian President, and the Secretary-General of the UN. The treatise allowed Baskera to legitimately take control of the government in the eyes of the international community, officially ending the conflict.\n\nA year later, 2034, Russian regulars who entered the region for peacekeeping have ended their deployments, and the UNA who took their place are soon to end theirs. In a controversial move, the UN has hired Synixe to take over logistical operations in the area, while also allowing Synixe to open contracts with the other parties in the region, promising not instigate further conflict in the region while the peacekeeping forces focus on packing up. While open conflict has ended, the rural nature of the AO has led to it being a difficult and dangerous region to rebuild, the main reason why Synixe is operating in this region only.\n\n<font color='#e3d310'>EMPLOYER</font>\nName: UNA\nLocation: Hööpakka, Heikkola\n\nTook over for Russian Forces in the region, but steadily being drawn down as the peace keeping mission comes to an end. While at first they were in the region to protect civilian and industrial infrastructure, they rarely intervene in fights anymore unless UNA assets are already involved. While mostly drawn away from the politics of the region, UNA forces are friendly to contractors and should have their support (what little there is) from UNA forces. Due to the nature of Synixe's main contract, contractors are expected to assist all UNA forces in the area.\n\n<font color='#d81717'>ENEMY FORCES</font>\nName: Kardishev Front\nLocation: Unknown\n\nUltra-nationalist, and now anti-government, paramilitary group, that has been operating in the region since before the civil conflict, and one of few to not surrender during the treatise signing. Made up of deserters, ex-soldiers, and radical civilians alike, they are hostile to all forces in the region that are part of, working with, or aiding the current government.\n\n<font color='#139120'>INDEPENDENT FORCES</font>\nName: Polk Baskera\nLocation: Nyman, Taipale, Rautakorpi\n\nWith the military being almost non-existant in the country due to treatises with Russia, a loop hole using unofficial government forces (under the control of the defacto political party) has allowed the government to project their power in the region. Due to the large smuggling operations and terrorist acitivity in the area, they are known to set up checkpoints and raid civilian housing and indurstrial areas.
