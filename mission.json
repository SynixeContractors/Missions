In the following months, resentment grew among Takistan against the United States and other 'terrorist' nations allied with them.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>Looking to gain intel on the brewing Takistani army, the US decided to deploy one of its new stealth drones in the region.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>At some point along the drone's flight path, it suffered an unknown malfunction and contact was lost. It is highly unlikely that Takistani forces brought it down, due to their outdated equipment. Based on the flight path and last known position, the US believes the drone crashed somewhere near the Takistani border village of Nur.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>Since the United States is to have no official presence in Takistan, we have been contracted to secure the crash site. Since it will be impossible to recover the drone in a timely manner, we have been ordered to destroy it. Secondarily, we are to recover any sensitive data the Takistani Army may have extracted (electronics/documents).\n            <br/>\n            <br/>Based on what recon the drone gathered before it was lost, the Takistan Army has only just entered the AO, with the majority of forces concentrated near the town of Rasman and the nearby airfield. A couple of Takistani fortifications were spotted in the town of Nur, however their presence has surely only increased since the crash.\n        "

However, the FIA has made it clear that if they find Giorgos Elias, they plan on executing him for treason. Secretly, the British government wants us to capture him alive and extract him. As such, it is vital that we reach him before the FIA does.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>When we find and secure Giorgos Elias, we are to immediately exfiltrate.

Due to Kushan Forces and sparse Coalition forces being mainly focused on the South, the situation quickly grew out of hand. The CIA has focused part of their attention on the warlord's forces in an attempt to keep the region stable, which has included the use of informants and insiders into the group.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>One informant (Jabr Anwari) has given the CIA many leads into the innerworkings of the group, although many of his physical leads being mixed bags. Upon further analysis, other insiders have reported this informant working with the Warlord to ambush and attack Kushanate Forces and Ground Branch teams working in the area. However, the informant has suddenly requested that he be brought out of the country in return for major information on the Warlord's location. It seems that the Warlord's forces were unaware that the informant was working with the United States, leading to the Warlord putting a large bounty on his head.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>With Synixe contractors already in the area, we have been hired by the CIA to secure the informant and bring him to the outpost in Ben Geurrir. \n            <br/>\n            <br/>Due to the make and distance of the terrain, the CIA will provide transport into the AO to a pre-designated LZ a kilometer away from the town of Oum Ali (where the informant is located).
