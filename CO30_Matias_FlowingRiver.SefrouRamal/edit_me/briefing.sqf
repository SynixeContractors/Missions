            <br/>Three days ago a firefight took place near a water treatment plant that supplies local towns, when the firefight ended key equipment in the plant was damaged after a UNA tank fired on it.
            <br/>UNA engineers are already working on fixing the water treatment plant, in the meantime Synixe has been hired to deliver boxes filled with water bottles to the towns that no longer have acces to clean drinking water.
            <br/>UNA has also asked us to deliver a toolkit to the engineer crew in the water treatment plant and some water to a checkpoint.
            <br/>
            <br/>Synixe has been provided with a HEMTT in order to transport the water, UNA is worried that Tura insurgents will attempt to stop the water delivery in orden to worsen UNA realtions with the locals.
            <br/>Scouts have been spotted around the base so be on the lookout for hostile forces while in transit to the towns. We are authorized to open fire on anyone who attempts to stop us from delivering the water.
