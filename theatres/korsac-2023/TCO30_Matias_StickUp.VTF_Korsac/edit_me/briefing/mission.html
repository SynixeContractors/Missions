A member of the Korsac Armed Locals was walking around an area in the North West of the region when he spotted a group of Separatists gathered around a campfire.

Further surveillance of the area has revealed that the KS have been setting up camps in the area and using them to safeguard supplies ranging from weapons to ammunition.

Contractors must move into the area and clear any enemy camps that they find, destroyin whatever supply caches they find along the way.
