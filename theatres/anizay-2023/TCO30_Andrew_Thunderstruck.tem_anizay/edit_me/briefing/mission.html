YOU CAN ADD AS MUCH AS YOU FEEL IS RELEVANT

AS A RULE OF THUMB, CONSIDER: WHO, WHAT (TASKS), WHERE, WHEN, AND WHY

IT IS HELPFUL TO INCLUDE THE ENEMY AMLCOA AND WHAT WE EXPECT OF THEM, IF KNOWN
(MOST LIKELY COURSE OF ACTION, AKA, WHAT THEY'RE DOING, HOW THEY ACT, HOW THEY'LL ACT TOWARDS US, WHAT WE KNOW, ETC)
=======
THE United Assistance have requested backup from a planned assault in the town of Makan aljamal. They repelled the attack and wish to carry out a counter offensive but lack the manpower to do so. We've been called upon as a QRF to snuff out the enemy.

The Anizay Freedom Insurgency were seen retreating with some injuried members to the southwest into the open desert. We have a good assumption, based on previous encounters, this organized group tends to stick where no one can see them. The assumption is that they're in the desert.

As a precaution, United Assistance members have been searching the nearby towns for any traces of the Anizay Freedom Insurgency (shown with the blue markers). Our tasking is the dunes.
