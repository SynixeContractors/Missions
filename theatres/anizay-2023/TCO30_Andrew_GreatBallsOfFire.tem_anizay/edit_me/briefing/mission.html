With the region of Anizay in disarray, the United Alliance is spread vast and thin. Synixe has been called upon to act as the QRF force to react to the chaos that has taken place throughout the night.
There have been reports of potential Anizay Freedom Insurgents shooting into homes and lighting them ablaze in Rangrezan in the middle of the late evening, several hours ago. Since then, it is believed that the Anizay Freedom Insurgents have moved to the east. Reports indicate that they've been spotted outside Zarifkheyl and some armed men and vehicles inside Deraz. The enemy seems very capable with vehicles and different forms of personnel to be out and about. Be wary.

We are asked to assist the United Assistance with helping the locals in need by clearing out all three towns, and anything else we possibly uncover. Synixe is not expected to be a firefighting team, but is asked to remove all possible threats from the area before first responders get on the scene(s).

Be mindful that the civilians are making reports from within that region, meaning they're still present there. The United Alliance have numerous reports received and are working diligently to assist who they can. You may encounter the United Alliance, or other friendly forces throughout your patrols. Watch your fire and watch your six.
