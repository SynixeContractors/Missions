After the botched evacuation and due to AFI using civilians as bargaining chips our employer has decided to deliver food and medical supplies to several towns in order to both boost public perception and help the civilians that are trapped.

It has been decided that the towns that will be receiving the aid are Khas, Seyyedan and Salam. The supplies will be picked up FOB Nauzad, they will be waiting for you near the main entrance.

Should you encounter any enemy presence, it must be neutralized in order to weaken the AFI.
