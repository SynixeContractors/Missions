With the ongoing violence facing the region of Anizay, United Assistance have put forth a plan to provide necessary resources to numerous villages in need. This morning, two IDAP water trucks were dispatched to the southern town of Bum from FOB Nauzad. The first water truck made it without any issues. Leaving several hours after the first, the second truck did not arrive to the destination. There were required check-in's for the drivers to make along their route. The second water truck made their third required check-in. That driver failed to radio in at any check-in after that.

Synixe's tasking is relatively simple. Discover who took the water truck and if possible, recover and deliver it to the proper destination.

It is suspected that the Anizay Freedom Insurgency has a hand in the truck disappearance, so be on the lookout for them. This collective is probably storing it locally at a nearby camp as neither the United Assistance or Anizay Militia have any reports of this truck. Anizay militia have been constantly patrolling the eastern neighboring towns, specifically the town of Mian. The Anizay militia have stated that they have not seen any IDAP water trucks come through and have proceeded to have several blockades along the east.

Be on the lookout for any Anizay Freedom Insurgency. They are most likely the culprit as the United Assistance and the Anizay Militia are the ones organizing the support to the local population. This fits their motive and tactics in recent memory. We suspect that the water truck is not in a local town as they usually avoid towns unless they're looking to gain something or for a demenstration. They most definitely attack on sight.
