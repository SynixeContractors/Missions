A UA officer -Noah Walker- is believed to have been kidnapped by the Anizay Freedom Insurgency three hours ago at 0400. The Anizay Militia has been stretched thin and has been unable to assist with CSAR (Combat Search and Rescue) operations. The latest intel puts him in somewhere in Zaranj, Musakhan, or Khas.

Synixe has been tasked with conducting CSAR operations to rescue the UA officer, and bringing him back to your FOB where the UA will coordinate pickup.
