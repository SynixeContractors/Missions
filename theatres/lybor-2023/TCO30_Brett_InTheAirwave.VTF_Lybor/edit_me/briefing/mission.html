The Lybor Government has learned that the Russo-Lyborian Separatists are planning to disrupt communications infrastructure in the area.

An old radio building that has long been abandoned was scheduled for a routine check up by a local safety inspector.

The inspector has not been heard from in several hours, and a civilian call reported a gunshot in the area.
