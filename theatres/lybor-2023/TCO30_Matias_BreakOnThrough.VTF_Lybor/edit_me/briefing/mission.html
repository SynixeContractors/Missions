Recently the Russo-Lyborian Separatists took over two industrial sites to the west of the region and are believed to be using them as staging points for further incursions into tows.

Synixe has been tasked with moving into and clearing the industrial sites, destroying any supplies that the enemies may have been gathering along the way.
