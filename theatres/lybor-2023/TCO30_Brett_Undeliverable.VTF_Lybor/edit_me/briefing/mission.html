The Russo-Lybor Separtists are preparing to receive a shipment of weapons from Russia.

We know they receive them via airdrop in the northern mountains, but we don't know the exact location.

Some possible locations have been marked in red, along with some known camp locations they've used in the past in yellow.

Intercept as many of the supplies as you can, take anything back to your base as you can, destroy the rest.
