An armed group working for the traffickers have been operating an outpost near the town of Harcourt.

Thanks to an inside source at the Harcourt docks, we know that a shipment of their supplies have arrived and will be transported to the outpost today.

Follow the men taking the supplies to the outpost, and destroy the outpost.
