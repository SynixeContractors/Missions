Tanoa's rising industrial sector has been stagnating in recent years as the Tanoan population is not large enough to sustain the growth on its own.

As a result, a human trafficking problem has been growing in the region.
The local Tanoa government had previously been turning a blind eye to the problem, as the traffickers are paying them off.
However, the situation has gotten out of hand, and the Horizon Islands Government has begun to crack down on the traffickers.
The small Horizon Islands Legion is not suited for such operations, and have requested the expertise of Synixe Contractors.

The HIL is a small and inexperienced military force, and is not suited for the task of dealing with the traffickers.

Civilians in the region have varying opinions on the traffickers.
Some have been paid off, some are upset about the lowering of wages as a result of the traffickers importing cheap labor.
Some are upset about the human rights violations, and some are just upset about the increased crime rate.
Fear of the traffickers is common, as they are known to be retaliatory against those who speak out against them.
