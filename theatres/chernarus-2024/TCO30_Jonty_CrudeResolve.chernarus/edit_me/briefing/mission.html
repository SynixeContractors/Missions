The RSA currently controls the oil fields in the northern region of Chernarus. The objective is to retake the oil fields and disrupt the RSA's ability to fund their operations. Intelligence reports suggest that the RSA has relocated most of its mechanized units, including tanks and anti-air assets, to defend the north-eastern airfield. This has created an opportunity for CDF to clear the area of enemy infantry presence.

Synixe Contractors are tasked with clearing the region of enemy infantry presence. Once the area is secure, find and hack the intelligence from the Field HQ. Upon successfully hacking and uploading the intel to the server, a CDF armored convoy will move in to reinforce and secure the position.

Colonel Petrovich is unavailable as he's reporting to the CDF HQ to plan next steps for the CDF and Synixe but intelligence gathered by CDF is available on the notepad in his office.
