Colonel Ivan Petrovich, a seasoned veteran of the Chernarus military, stands before a large map of Chernarus, his eyes scanning the territories under threat. With the rise of the CMORS, the once peaceful regions have become battlegrounds. Petrovich's orders are clear: reclaim and hold strategic locations across Chernarus, ensuring the safety of its citizens and the stability of the government.

He is known for his tactical acumen and unwavering loyalty to Chernarus. His appearance is distinguished by his neatly trimmed beard and sharp gaze. He carries himself with the confidence of a leader who has faced adversity head-on. His equipment is standard CDF issue, reflecting his focus on the mission rather than personal adornment. His motives are simple yet profound: to protect Chernarus from the tyranny of CMORS and restore peace.

Colonel Petrovich is stationed with Synixe contractors at Forward Operating Base Vyshnoye. From this strategic position, Petrovich commands CDF forces directly, providing intelligence to Synixe. The FOB is heavily guarded by patrols and equipped with overwatch towers, ensuring a vigilant watch over the surrounding terrain. Additionally, a unit is stationed in the abandoned castle towards the southern side of the FOB, utilizing its elevated vantage point for comprehensive surveillance.

The FOB is equipped with various state-of-the-art military-grade intelligence equipment, including an advanced surveillance station to the north, encrypted communication systems, and sophisticated analytical software. These tools enable Synixe contractors to gather real-time data, analyze patterns of enemy movements, and coordinate operations efficiently.
