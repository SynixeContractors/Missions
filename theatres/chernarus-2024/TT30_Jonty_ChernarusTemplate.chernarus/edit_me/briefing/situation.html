In late 2024, Chernarus was on the precipice of a pivotal moment in its history, with national government elections set to determine the course of the nation. However, instead of marking a democratic transition, these elections became the catalyst for a bitter conflict that would divide the nation. The conservative government, long in power, faced a challenge from a radical opposition party, whose members accused the incumbent administration of electoral fraud and corruption. This accusation sparked widespread discontent and ignited a political firestorm.

The tension escalated when the leader of the radical opposition, leveraging support from a faction within the military, orchestrated a swift takeover of the northern part of Chernarus. This move included securing key strategic assets such as airports and oil fields, effectively giving them control over the nation's trade routes, import and export channels, and a significant portion of its oil supply. This strategic advantage allowed the radicals to consolidate their power and extend their influence across the region.

In response to this coup, the Chernarus Defense Forces (CDF) initiated operations aimed at reclaiming control over the country. Their objective was twofold: to retake the strategically vital areas lost to the radicals and to ensure conditions conducive to holding a fair re-election, which the radicals vehemently opposed. The CDF's efforts were met with fierce resistance, as the radicals sought to maintain their grip on power through force. The current situation in Chernarus is one of escalating conflict and uncertainty. The northern part of the country remains under the control of the radical faction, which continues to use its strategic advantages to bolster its position.

Synixe Contractos are hired by the conservative party to support the CDF's fight to regain control and restore order, aiming to pave the way for a free and fair election that truly represents the will of the Chernarus people.

Understanding the limitations of the Chernarus Defense Forces (CDF) in conducting stealthy and covert operations, the Chernarussian Conservative Party sought out Synixe Contractors for their specialized skills in such areas. The CDF, while valiant and committed, lacks the training and experience required for quick and covert missions that are crucial in the current political climate.

Name: Chernarussian Movement of the Red Star (CMORS)
Location: Northern Chernarus

A well-equipped faction, with access to advanced weaponry and communications systems. Their motives are driven by a desire to overthrow the conservative government, which they accuse of corruption and electoral fraud.

Name: Chernarus Defense Forces (CDF)
Location: Strongholds on the outskirts of Chernarus

The CDF, while not as well-equipped as CMORS, is a disciplined and dedicated force. Their equipment is a mix of outdated Russian made arms and newer models bought from NATO, indicative of limited funding and support. Their primary motive is to protect the conservative government and restore order. Their orders are to retake lost territories and prepare for a fair re-election.

Name: Chernarus Civilian Militia
Location: Various towns and villages across Chernarus

Throughout Chernarus, local leaders have formed civilian militias to defend their communities against both CMORS and CDF incursions. These groups vary widely in size and capabilities but share a common goal: to preserve their way of life and resist external control. Their equipment ranges from homemade weapons to salvaged military hardware. Their motives are rooted in self-preservation and a deep love for their homeland.

The civilian population of Chernarus holds a mixed opinion regarding the ongoing conflict. Approximately half of the population harbors grievances against the radicals, accusing them of destabilizing the country and violating human rights. These individuals support the conservative government and the CDF's efforts to reclaim control. Conversely, the other half sympathizes with the radicals, viewing them as champions against governmental corruption and oppression. This division complicates the situation, as it becomes challenging for either side to gain a decisive upper hand without addressing the underlying societal divides.
