In late 2024, Chernarus was on the precipice of a pivotal moment in its history, with national government elections set to determine the course of the nation. However, instead of marking a democratic transition, these elections became the catalyst for a bitter conflict that would divide the nation. The conservative government, long in power, faced a challenge from a radical opposition party, whose members accused the incumbent administration of electoral fraud and corruption. This accusation sparked widespread discontent and ignited a political firestorm.

The tension escalated when the leader of the radical opposition, Mikhail Volkov, leveraging support from a faction within the military known as the Red Star Alliance, orchestrated a swift takeover of the northern part of Chernarus. This move included securing key strategic assets such as airports and oil fields, effectively giving them control over the nation's trade routes, import and export channels, and a significant portion of its oil supply. This strategic advantage allowed the radicals to consolidate their power and extend their influence across the region.

In response to this coup, the Chernarus Defense Forces (CDF) initiated operations aimed at reclaiming control over the country. Their objective was twofold: to retake the strategically vital areas lost to the radicals and to ensure conditions conducive to holding a fair re-election, which the radicals vehemently opposed. The CDF's efforts were met with fierce resistance, as the radicals sought to maintain their grip on power through force. The current situation in Chernarus is one of escalating conflict and uncertainty. The northern part of the country remains under the control of the radical faction, which continues to use its strategic advantages to bolster its position.

Recognizing the gravity of the situation, the official government and military forces have called upon international support, including NATO, to restore order and ensure the democratic process is upheld. Our mission is to work alongside the official government and military to stabilize the region and support the legitimate authorities in maintaining control and security.

Understanding the limitations of the Chernarus Defense Forces (CDF) in conducting stealthy and covert operations, the Chernarus Military Command sought out Synixe Contractors for their specialized skills in such areas. The CDF, while valiant and committed, lacks the training and experience required for quick and covert missions that are crucial in the current political climate.

Name: Red Star Alliance (RSA)
Location: Northern Chernarus

Originally a part of the Chernarus Defense Forces (CDF), the Red Star Alliance (RSA) has essentially gone rogue, following the orders of the radical opposition party. With access to advanced weaponry and communications systems, the RSA has seized control over existing military equipment of the CDF. Motivated by a desire to overthrow the conservative government, which they accuse of corruption and electoral fraud, their directives are to expand their influence, secure strategic assets in the south, and maintain control over the northern part of Chernarus.

The Chernarus Defense Forces (CDF), despite being outmatched by the Red Star Alliance in terms of equipment, have maintained a strong presence thanks to the financial support from the government. Recognizing the strategic importance of supporting the legitimate authorities in maintaining control and security, NATO acknowledged the CDF's efforts and agreed to provide them with advanced equipment. This decision came after the CDF requested direct intervention from NATO, a request that was initially rebuffed due to NATO's concerns over escalating the conflict and its desire to avoid direct involvement in what is perceived as an internal affair.

Name: Chernarus Civilian Militia
Location: Various towns and villages across Chernarus

Throughout Chernarus, local leaders have formed civilian militias to defend their communities against both RSA and CDF incursions. These groups vary widely in size and capabilities but share a common goal: to preserve their way of life and resist external control. Their equipment ranges from homemade weapons to salvaged military equiment. Their motives are rooted in self-preservation and a deep love for their homeland.

The civilian population of Chernarus holds a mixed opinion regarding the ongoing conflict. Approximately half of the population harbors grievances against the radicals, accusing them of destabilizing the country and violating human rights. These individuals support the conservative government and the CDF's efforts to reclaim control. Conversely, the other half sympathizes with the radicals, viewing them as champions against governmental corruption and oppression. This division complicates the situation, as it becomes challenging for either side to gain a decisive upper hand without addressing the underlying societal divides.
