CDF has been ordered to take control of the Krasnostav airstrip located in the northeast of Chernarus. This airstrip, though isolated, is heavily fortified and the enemy is anticipating retaliation. Intelligence gathered from the previous operation on the oil fields revealed that the RSA plans to conduct air raids on the CDF strongholds. Two spotters sent to gather intel on the airstrip discovered a gunship and a stealth jet stationed there. Unfortunately, they were captured, and their GPS locations indicate they are being held in Olsha.

Synixe Contractors are tasked with capturing the radar station at Mount Klen to gain a strategic vantage point over the airfield. After securing the radar station, move into the Krasnostav airfield to destroy the Kajman gunship and the Shikra stealth jet, neutralizing the RSA's air raid capabilities. Lastly, rescue the captured CDF personnel from Olsha and ensure their safe return.

Once the assets are located, a CDF convoy stationed at Gvodno will move in to secure.
