Last night, a significant amount of civilian traffic was observed moving into the southwestern side of Chernarus. Stronghold West faced substantial challenges in inspecting all the vehicles due to the sheer volume. Additionally, CDF intelligence has intercepted increased radio chatter originating from the towns of Pavlovo and Kamenka. Civilians have reported that many individuals in these towns are armed with rifles, raising concerns about potential hostile activity. Col. Petrovich fears that the RSA may be planning to disguise themselves as civilians and launch an assault on the HQ in Chernogorsk. CDF thinks that RSA brought in military equipment and personnel disguised as civilians. We need to make sure no civilians are harmed during the conflict.

Synixe Contractors are tasked with moving into these areas and conduct a thorough investigation of the equipment brought in by these vehicles. Be on the lookout for suspicious vehicles and check their inventory meticulously. Ensure that no civilians are injured during the operation, as maintaining public safety is paramount. Anticipate encountering explosives and IEDs, and proceed with extreme caution.
