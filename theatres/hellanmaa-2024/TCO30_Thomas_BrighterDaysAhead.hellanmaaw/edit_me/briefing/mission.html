Contractors have been tasked with supplying the IDAP camps in the region.

The usual shipments to the IDAP camps have turned up missing supplies due to attacks on the Polk Baskera convoys bringing them from the interior, leading to the IDAP camps missing essential supplies to operate in the area.

Deliver supplies evenly between each camp, and ensure the safety of the nearby area so that IDAP can resume their operations.
