August 17th, 2029, a mass assanination attempt on the leaders of the regional government succeeded, leaving a large power vacuum that would lead to a 4 year long civil conflict between multiple armed groups. As of January 2nd, last year, an official treatise to end the conflict was signed by Onni Baskera (Acting leader of the Baskera Communion Party), the Russian President, and the Secretary-General of the UN. The treatise allowed Baskera to legitimately take control of the government in the eyes of the international community, officially ending the conflict.

A year later, 2034, Russian regulars who entered the region for peacekeeping have ended their deployments, and the UNA who took their place are soon to end theirs. In a controversial move, the UN has hired Synixe to take over logistical operations in the area, while also allowing Synixe to open contracts with the other parties in the region, promising not instigate further conflict in the region while the peacekeeping forces focus on packing up. While open conflict has ended, the rural nature of the AO has led to it being a difficult and dangerous region to rebuild, the main reason why Synixe is operating in this region only.

Took over for Russian Forces in the region, but steadily being drawn down as the peace keeping mission comes to an end. While at first they were in the region to protect civilian and industrial infrastructure, they rarely intervene in fights anymore unless UNA assets are already involved. While mostly drawn away from the politics of the region, UNA forces are friendly to contractors and should have their support (what little there is) from UNA forces. Due to the nature of Synixe's main contract, contractors are expected to assist all UNA forces in the area.

Ultra-nationalist, and now anti-government, paramilitary group, that has been operating in the region since before the civil conflict, and one of few to not surrender during the treatise signing. Made up of deserters, ex-soldiers, and radical civilians alike, they are hostile to all forces in the region that are part of, working with, or aiding the current government.

With the military being almost non-existant in the country due to treatises with Russia, a loop hole using unofficial government forces (under the control of the defacto political party) has allowed the government to project their power in the region. Due to the large smuggling operations and terrorist acitivity in the area, they are known to set up checkpoints and raid civilian housing and indurstrial areas. Generally will not care about contractor operations in the area, and may assist on rare occasion. However the UN has noted the organization as being very corrupt, and have been known to have shady dealings with outside parties.

In the region providing medical aid and food to civilians while also heading mutliple demining operations in the area. Known to show up to finished firefights to provide medical aid to whoever needs it, generally leading them to be hazed, harassed, and even attacked by both Polk Baskera and the Kardishev Front.

Civilians are not allowed to own most small arms, except for hunting. However it's possible many civilians, and smugglers, still possess massive amounts of weapons and explosives. Likewise, armed gatherings are illegal and will generally result in a visit from Polk Baskera. With the recent civil conflict, civilian loyalites are still mostly split and unknown.
