UNA forces don't leave their bases much anymore, only to escort IDAP resources and to assist the very few UNA forces outside the wire that are under fire. However, a KF saboteur team(s) has been specifically targeting UNA assets in the area, making any UNA assistance to both humanitarian assets and each other near impossible as they risk further casualties.

Contractors have been tasked with hunting the team(s) responsible and stopping them from attacking UNA forces for the time being. However the saboteurs haven't been able to be tracked, leaving it up to synixe to ascertain their whereabouts.

It is believed that one of the nearby garrisons may know the location of the camp as they are coordinating supply runs for the saboteur team(s), allowing the them to stay active in the field indefinitely. 

It is hoped that by attacking at night, contractors can catch the garrisons and the saboteur teams while they are off guard, as PB tends to only operate during the day time. This is also meant to keep synixe from starting fights in areas where civilians may be working.

UNA and PB intelligence doubts that contractors will be able to take KF saboteur teams by suprise.
