UNA and PB in the area have been experiencing an increase in mortar attacks on their bases in the area. The UNA have raised PB to help them curb KF's weapons smuggling operations, however they have been ineffective at doing so.

A PB officer, more sympathetic to UNA operations in the area than most, leaked that he overheard that the Nyman garrison commander, and some other officers, secured the location of multiple hidden mortar positions from a KF prisoner they had detained the previous week.

Since nothing had been done with the information, he believed they were intentionally hiding the info.

The officer was not sure where bases are in the AO, but he is certain he heard that there are two camps in the vicinity of each UNA base within the provided search area.

Synixe Contractors has been hired to hunt down and destroy the camps, while scuttling any mortars or supplies found.
