An IDAP aid convoy traveling from Luoma to Hööpakka has gone missing. Intelligence received from the Hööpakka camp suggests their last known location was one and a half miles North-East from the camp. Reports indicate the Kardishev Front, retreating from the last assault on the radio hideouts, known for their hostility towards humanitarian efforts, is responsible for the disappearance. The convoy consisted of 10 personnel, and your primary objective is to locate them, secure the area, and return any survivors or casualties to our FOB.
