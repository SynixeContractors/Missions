A man by the name of Edvin Mäkelä reported to the UN that he believed a friend of his was in serious trouble, and being targeted by the Kardishev Front. For his safety, he refused to provide the name of his friend. The UNA has tasked Synixe Contractors with investigating the situation and extracting any civilians in danger.

The man wasn't very specific about the nature of the threat, just that his friend had become paranoid and was convinced that the Kardishev Front was after him. The UNA has passed along the location of the man's house, at the south edge of Troihari.
