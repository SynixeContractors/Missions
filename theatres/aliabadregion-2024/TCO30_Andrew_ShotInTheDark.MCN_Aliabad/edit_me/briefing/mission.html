The CIA has reached out for us to do a wellness check on one of their operatives. Their operative has been unresponsive and not shown to their rendevous point. The CIA Operative was hiding out in Narmaki and the rendevous point is at Dahana Ridge. 

It would be in our best interest to check on him in Narmaki and go from there. If we find the operative, please return him to the rendevous at Dahana Ridge. Local security forces will be there to take him in.
