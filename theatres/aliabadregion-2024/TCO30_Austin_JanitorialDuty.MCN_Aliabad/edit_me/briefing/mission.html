Earlier today, a raid was conducted to capture and extract several high-value targets from a remote compound south-east of Ahmad Golam.
The CIA believes these targets are highly involved in the sourcing and distribution of weapons to Al-Qaeda cells here in Aliabad and, consequently, abroad.
Of note, we have three names:

-Saif Uallah: Confirmed involvement in the trade of armored vehicles and anti-tank weapons.
-Abdul-Bari: Bombmaker believed to have been killed by his own devices; recent activity suggests otherwise.
-Maryam Sayed: Has traces to several purchases of used trucks, possibly connected to the construction of technicals.

Capturing these targets would provide the key to understanding Al-Qaeda logistics and aid in future plans for their destruction.

However, resistance faced during our raid proved far too greater than we could handle. This, in conjunction with several errors of our own, has led to several
casualties on our end. Fortunately, no lives were lost. Unfortunately, our high-value targets were able to escape in the confusion.

Our objective today is simple: clean up this mess and finish the job. The CIA isn't keen on losing this opportunity to snatch all three
targets at once, but they do recognize the increased risk of going back in. So, all they expect of us is to capture, at the very least, Saif Uallah.

Given how recently the raid occurred, it's very likely our targets are still within the local vicinity. It might be worth searching
the remote compound for any intel that was left behind, but UAV surveillance confirms an enemy QRF deployed on-site.
Additionally, we could also infer that the response in the region to this raid is somewhat delayed.
We can expect high activity closest to the raid location, while garrisons in the outer region might not even be aware.
The enemy's composition should be comprised of foot patrols and, at worst, motorized QRF.
