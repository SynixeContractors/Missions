Welcome to Aliabad. Aliabad has been recently linked to terrorism, in that cells are believed to be in the region. Al-Qaeda personnel have been crossing the borders of the United States of America, Canada, Great Britain, France, and Germany. These world powers have banded together and found ties to the Aliabad region. It has gone so far as the CIA is heavily involved.

The CIA tends to operate in the covert of darkness and shadow. They do not like to be associated directly, but rather have others do their work for them. The CIA have been established for about two weeks now. There is a local PMC group protecting the inner grounds, with hired locals acting as the outer perimeter security. With the CIA outsourcing their military prowness, Synixe have been hired to assist and infilitrate any information that can find on terrorist cells or personnel in the region.

Terrain considerations: Aliabad is known for their desert along a coastline. With spaced out villages and towns, the terrain is vast and open.

The CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) is known as a civilian foreign intelligence service of the United States Government. Throughout history, this agency has been gathering, processing, and analyzing information important to national security through covert means. Their goal in this region is evidence gathering and counterterrorism. While they do not act directly, they have hired a separate private military contractor and locals to defend them and their interests.

Name: Al-Qaeda
Al-Qaeda is a pan-Islamuist militant organization led by the Sunni Jihadists. Their soul purpose is for a global Islamist revolution; to unite the world in their Muslim beliefs and the Islamic state of Caliphate.
The world is on red alert with members of their organization sprouting in different countries across the world. These members believe us to be infidels, and are part of a war against the Muslim religion. They will stop at nothing to remove us from their lands. Al-Qaeda are known to have access to Russian and some American firearms and gear. When all else fails, they will take their own life in the name of Allah if you will be taken with them. Al-Qaeda are also known for guerilla tactics and power by numbers rather than technology.
Al-Qaeda can be anywhere in the region, so it is important to be mindful of where you are and where you step. Al-Qaeda does not know about CIA's occupancy, but they are familiar with our presence. They will begin to try to find out location as soon as possible, and even the CIA's if they became aware of their presence.
They use a myriad of vehicles and are known to have access to tanks and helicopters. Previous occupancies and arms dealers grant Al-Qaeda the possible access to U.S., NATO, and Russian grade military gear.

Name: Hired Aliabad Private Military Contractors
Locations: Outside the outer walls of the CIA compound and neighboring towns.
Tasked to provide surveillance and outer security to the CIA. They are deemed independent rather than friendly as they are still locals and well they were vetted by the CIA, any member could have ties to Al-Qaeda... or be paid off. As long as the money flows, hopefully their alligence stays to the CIA.
