Aliabad has been a place of controversy and violence throughout history. Plagued with constant battles and turmoil, many see this region as an opportunity for profit. One man's loss is another's gain, as the saying goes. Plenty of world governments have come and gone through this area. Every time one group leaves, a power vacuum occurs where someone seizes their opportunity to take the reigns.

With multiple forces such as the United States, Great Britain, Russia, and NATO, the area has an overabundance of personnel in the region. In addition to these world powers, there are multiple PMC groups looking to stake a claim in the riches this part of the world could present to them.

All major forces are in an agreement as to work together in the region. Thus, USA, Great Britain, Russia, and NATO are all working together.

Terrain considerations: Aliabad is known for their desert along a coastline. With spaced out villages and towns, the terrain is vast and open.
