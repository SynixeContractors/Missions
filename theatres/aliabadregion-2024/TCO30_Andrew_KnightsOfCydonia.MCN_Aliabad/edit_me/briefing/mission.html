CIA has been feeding us on intel for possible incursion activity. Al-Qaeda have pushed into the town of Wolak in their attempts for recruitment. Intel suggests that while Wolak is not "Pro Al-Qaeda", they aren't anti Al-Qaeda either. It is anticipated that the town will go under lockdown with Al-Qaeda creating a network from within.
The CIA will not let this happen, and it is our tasking to go, clear it out of Al-Qaeda fighters, removing any threats or hostiles from the area. They are expecting HEAVY numbers of enemy combantants. In addition, assist the local population if anything they may need.
