In the dead of night several criminal groups moved in and seized control of settlements in the islands of Selamat, Moko and Lepar; kicking out the population and obtaining control of their means of production.

Synixe is being sent in as a QRF and is tasked with clearing out these settlements so that the civilians can move back in.
