In order to keep the export of sugarcane going Synixe is being sent to make several pickups of sugarcane shipments from different towns that dedicate themselves to the production of it.

Contractors are tasked with going to Minanga, Lalomo, Apal and a small family run farm south east of Apal that doubles as an auto shop. There contractors are to pick up wooden crates, the correct crates will be marked by yellow flags on each side of them. The big tows are expected to have five crates each, while the small farm is expected to have only one.

Contractors will be provided with a HEMTT cargo truck to do the pickups, due to space distribution issues it is advised contractors load the smaller crate last but they can make more than one trip if they desire.
