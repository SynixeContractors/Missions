At 0430 a helicopter that was leaving Gurun Airfield with a shipment of sugarcane was suddenly hit by a rocket and made a hard landing. Just mere seconds after, enemy forces swarmed the airfield taking workers prisoner and seizing the airfiled hoping to shoot down any other aerial vehicles that are loaded with sugarcane.

Local law enforcement immediatley blockadeded all roads leading up to the airfield in order to prevent civlians from approaching and to know if any of the culprits attend to get away through them; however they are unable to mount an assualt and have therefore asked Synixe to do so.

Contractors must first and foremost recover the sugarcane which was being transported in six metal cases, they may also attempt to retake the airfield, rescue any civilians and find the pilots that were in the helicopter.
