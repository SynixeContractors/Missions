Early in the morning the opposing force made a last ditch effort to try and make money in order to keep operating. They rushed the resort and town of Tanjung, killing any Theseus contractors they came across and are now holding the area for ransom. They expect the owner to pay, however the owner has decided to send us as a QRF to clear the area of any enemies.

Contractors must mobilize into the area and clear the resort and Tanjung of enemies, Theseus have also asked us to check the locations were their contractors were stationed and see if any of them are alive. Theseus had contractors staged in several checkpoints, and two men each in the resort and the town.

Intel indicates that the enemies have set up an AA emplacement in the AO, Theseus has offered to send some men in a helicopter to aid us in clearing Tanjung if we neutralize the AA.
