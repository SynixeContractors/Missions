The Pulau government is preparing for a major sugarcane export operation from its eastern shores. To ensure the safety and security of the operation, a large portion of the Pulau National Police force has been deployed to the eastern coast, leaving other areas vulnerable to threats.

According an informant of the Pulau Police, pirates and revolutionaries, drawn by the reduced security presence, are planning a raid on this part of the island. Intel provided by the informant is available on the map.

Synixe Contractors are tasked by the Pulau National Police to safeguard Pulau Monyet and its inhabitants from the pirate threat until the sugarcane shipments have been safely exported and the police forces can return to reinforce the island's security.
