URGENT:
Last night, around midnight, I noticed unusual movement on the abandoned Mandomai Island and nearby waters. Possible human activity on land and multiple boats maneuvering behind the island. With current police focus on eastern coast, Mandomai's shores were unguarded. Potential pirate presence on the shores already. Suggest immediate security assessment and increased patrols in the area.
