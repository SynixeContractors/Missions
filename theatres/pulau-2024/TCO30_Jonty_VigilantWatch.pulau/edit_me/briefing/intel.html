URGENT:
Last night, around midnight, I noticed unusual movement on the abandoned Mandomai Island and nearby waters. Possible human activity on land and multiple boats maneuvering behind the island. With current police focus on eastern coast, Monyet's shores were unguarded. Potential revolutionaries presence in the Nurul and Keras settlements. Suggest immediate security assessment and increased patrols in the area.
