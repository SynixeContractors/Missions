            <br/>The government has mounted an invasion of the island and wants contractors to secure several landing points so that AAF troops can reach the shore safely.

            <br/>Ninety minutes after contractors begin their assault on the positions several AAF troops will head for the coast. It is imperative that most of the troops survive the assault so that the invasion can continue.

            <br/>As trained and equipped as the AAF are, it is recommended that contractors don't rely on their ability to capture the objectives by their lonesome.
