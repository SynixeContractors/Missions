We've been hired by the CIA to find a Al-Qaeda cell leader. Abdul Akar has been wanted for hundreds of reasons and there was finally an idea as to where he is. 
Abdul Akar has been linked to hiding out in the desert. We are to camp out and begin a search for him in the region. The only known thing out there is a pipeline for oil. Other than that, it's just pure desert. We have no intel as to what is out there but if he is out there, we expect a plethora of militants with him. Heads on a swivel, you'll move at dawn.

Abdul Akar was seen unarmed with a white headpiece on. He is known to be moving with bodyguards and easily identifiable with his white headpiece.
If at all possible, bring him back alive. But if anything else, kill the son of a bitch.
