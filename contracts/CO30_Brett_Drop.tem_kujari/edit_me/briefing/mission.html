The Kujari Military has been dealing with foreign sponsored rebel groups for the past few years.

The Islamic Revolution in Kujari (IRK) is well equipped, and have recently sent a force around the front lines to an airfield in a historically peaceful region.

If they are allowed to keep control of the airfield, they will be able to land supplies from thier foreign sponsors, and quickly take the large cities in the region.

The Kujari Military does not have resources in the region to divert, and have hired us to take control of the airfield before too many supplies have landed.

An air reconnaissance drone has confirmed the presence of infantry, light vehicles, a helicopter, and at least one large ground asset.

Due to the airfields remote nature, we have partnered with a local tour company to provide us with a trip in while raising hopefully little suspicion.
