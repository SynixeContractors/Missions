We've been contacted to help assist and recover civilians. A business was contacted for a retreat at an abandoned resort facility. Once arriving, civilians were split up. Some were taken off the main resort location. Those at the resort called in numerous gunshots and seeing people being murdered.
Synixe are being called as QRF to deal with the criminals. It is believed to be a local cartel behind the kidnapping and murder. Synixe are to rescue all civilians that they can, with secondary objectives being removing the threat from the immediate area.
The business members report that the hostages taken were loaded onto trucks and driven south of the resort. Best bet is to search the island for anything you can.

We have been provided boats to the west of our base. We do not have to use them, but they are provided if we so choose to.
