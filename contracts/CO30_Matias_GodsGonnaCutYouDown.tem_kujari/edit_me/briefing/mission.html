Kujari currently has a huge ongoing problem with poaching and overhunting of the local fauna and like in any place where this is an issue there is a group dedicating to stopping these poaching organizations.

Recently a team of operatives for the anti-poaching organization failed to show up for roll-call, when someone went to check on them in the village where they live they were found massacared along with their family members.

Synixe has been hired to go to the crime scene, investigate and find where the attackers are. Once this is done contractors are to bring the perpetrators to justice and investigate further in order to dismantle the local chapter of the poachers in the region. If possible we should also secure any intel from the poachers regarding buyers, transactions, etc.

We've been informed by the Anti-Poaching organization that if we were to find any of their documents they can provide us with the decryption key needed to decrypt them.
