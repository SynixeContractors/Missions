As a civil war breaks in Altis, the city of Kavala is under seige by the AAF.

Our client, Mr. Karmanlis, fears that a small group of people after his prized possessions will take advantage of the chaos to steal them.

We have been contracted to secure the items and return them to Mr. Karmanlis, who is safely outside of the city.

He says that 3 men were recently believed to be after his possessions, and that they were wearing Fieldsure backpacks.
