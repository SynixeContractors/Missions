The Royal Suonkomar Armed Forces (RSAF) have been bogged down in a deadly war of attrition against a prolific Wahhabi Jihadist militant group in South East Asia.

The RSAF has hired Synixe to help train their forces and to act as military advisors. However local intelligence has gained new intel which suggests a massive attack on RSAF forces stationed at FOB Emery.

Synixe Contractors are the closest to FOB Emery and RSAF have requested we help defend the FOB until they can muster enough reinforcements.
