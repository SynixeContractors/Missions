The border region of Virohlati has long been disputed between the Russian Federation and Finland. Recently, the local government shocked the international community by hosting a referendum, proposing independence from Finland. This was fueled by the Russian backed "Truth Party". Russia's involvement has sparked outrage.

The Russian Federation and CSAT have decided to help enforce Virolahti's independence from Finland by deploying a multilateral "peacekeeping" force to the region. Troops from Russia, Belarus and Iran have arrived to support the local police forces, and as a show of force to Finland and it's NATO allies.

The transition, although shocking, has gone relatively peaceful as CSAT and Russian forces perform live-fire military exercises to increase readiness.
Virolahti's local government has been looking to build up it's very own security forces; opening up the floor for military procurement and hardware demonstrations. The Russian Federation will be showcasing state-of-the-art military hardware with the intent to sell to Virolahti and CSAT.
