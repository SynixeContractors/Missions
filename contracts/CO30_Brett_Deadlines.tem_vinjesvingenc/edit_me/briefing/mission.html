The restoration forces are planning a major offensive, western intelligence has learned, and information has been passed on to the government forces. They are planning to launch an artillery attack from a former training facility, now knows as FOB Ã…bo.

The government forces are mainly made up of recent volunteers, and are not well trained, and the number of career soldiers is low. Therefor, they have requested assistance from the Synixe Contractors.

No support is available from the government forces, and we will be operating behind enemy lines. With help from an informant, we have been able to get into the region, and have been provided with a van and truck to use for the operation.
