Starting 4 years earlier, a "restoration" movement grew in support across the western region of the country. Creating a new political party, they were vying for reform to a nationalist government to "restore the nation".
They formed small militias and prepared in small groups to defend themselves from the government. After one of their party leaders was arrested for treason, the movement began an armed uprising against the government.
Initially the movement secured a decent amount of territory, but the government forces were able to organize, and the conflict has primarily been cold since, with only small amounts of territory changing hands.
Most civilians that did live in the west have moved to the far east of the country, away from the fighting and firmly under government control.

Name: Restoration Forces
Location: Front Lines, FOB Åbo, possibly patrolling the AO

Now being supported by the Russian Federation.
They are well equipped, but poorly trained and low in numbers.
They are currently attempting to launch an artillery attack from the former training facility at FOB Åbo.

Location: Throughout the AO

Very small numbers of civilians remain throughout the AO, but should not be near FOB Åbo.
Civilians mostly keep to themselves, but will likely support or possibly the restoration forces if they are present.
Since our operation is at night, they should not be a major concern.
