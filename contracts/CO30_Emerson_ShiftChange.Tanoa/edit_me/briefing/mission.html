Recently, the Horizon Islands has undergone significant changes in political structure. While the new government is moving in the right direction to be more effective and reduce corruption, the Horizon Islands are currently still experiencing instability from the change.

Under the previous government, a group of mercenaries called Eclipse was hired by corrupt officials to protect various farms and logistical sites. Eclipse is made up of many former American soldiers who were looking to make money using their experience. Various incidents have led to Eclipse being denounced by the United States, pushing Eclipse to look for work in other corners of the world.

Since the formation of the new Horizon Islands governemnt, Eclipse has refused to step down and hand over control of the areas they were previously hired to protect. Using their funds, Eclipse has hired more locals, some of which are Syndikat. By bribing and threatening locals, Eclipse has been able to remain in control of these areas.

Lacking the resources and experience to handle the situation, the new governemnt has hired us to secure several logistic sites in the designated AO. Eclipse and their mercenaries should be concentrated around the logistic sites, though they are known to occassionally transit between the areas they control. Civilians will be present in the designated AO, primarily in towns, trying to go about their daily lives.

An attempt to detain all armed pesonnel must be made before using deadly force. Detainees can be left grouped up on site; Gendarmerie will handle them afterwards. There are four (4) members of Eclipse that are considered HVTs and should be detained:
- Dustin "Viper" Slough
- Evan Slatten
- Nicholas Ridgeway
- Paul Heard
Identifying pictures of each HVT have been provided to us by the Horizon Islands government.

These individuals are the effective American leaders of Eclipse's operations on the island. They are known to use western equipment and clothing. We are to search for these HVTs or any clues of their whereabouts at each of the sites.
