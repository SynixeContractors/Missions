Recently, the Horizon Islands has undergone significant changes in political structure. While the new government is moving in the right direction to be more effective and reduce corruption, the Horizon Islands are currently still experiencing instability from the change.

Under the previous government, a group of mercenaries called Eclipse was hired by corrupt officials to protect various farms and logistical sites. Eclipse is made up of many former American soldiers who were looking to make money using their experience. Various incidents have led to Eclipse being denounced by the US, pushing Eclipse to look for work in other corners of the world.

Since the formation of the new Horizon Islands governemnt, Eclipse has refused to step down and hand over control of the areas they were previously hired to protect. Using their funds, Eclipse has hired more locals, some of which are Syndikat. By bribing and threatening locals, Eclipse has been able to remain in control of these areas.

Lacking the resources and experience to handle the situation, the new governemnt has hired us to secure and protect several logistic sites in the designated AO. All armed personnel are to be detained (when possible).

There are four (4) members of Eclipse that are considered HVTs and should be detained:
- Dustin "Viper" Slough
- Evan Slatten
- Nicholas Ridgeway
- Paul Heard

These individuals are the effective American leaders of Eclipse's operations on the island. They are known to use western equipment and clothing. We are to search for these HVTs or any clues of their whereabouts at each of the sites.
