Name: Eclipse Group
Location: Tanoa

Hired by corrupt politicians of Tanoa's previous government, these mercenaries have seemingly refused to vacate some of the logistical sites they were once paid to protect. They have refused to cooperate with Tanoa's new officials, instead opting to bribe and threaten locals to keep control. Using their funds, they have been able to buy out members of the Syndikat and add them to their ranks. The founders of Eclipse are known to use western equipment, unlike some of the lesser trained individuals.

Name: Syndikat
Location: Tanoa

An ever present issue, Tanoa has a number of criminal gangs and smugglers that conduct illicit activities. While the old government would turn a blind eye for the right price, the new government wishes to crackdown on their activity.

Location: Tanoa

Tanoan locals continue to try to live their lives across the whole island despite the recent changes. While most are supportive of the new government, many miss the stability (or appearance of stability) that the old governemnt provided. Locals try to avoid areas controlled by mercenaries, but sometimes it is not feasible to do so.
