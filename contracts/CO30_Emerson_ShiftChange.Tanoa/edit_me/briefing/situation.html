Hired by corrupt politicians of Tanoa's previous government, these mercenaries have seemingly refused to vacate the logistical sites they were once paid to protect. They have refused to cooperate with Tanoa's new officials, instead opting to bribe and threaten locals to keep control. Using their funds, they have been able to buy out members of the Syndikat and add them to their ranks.
