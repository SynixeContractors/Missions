Recently the MDF has been sizing up its armed forces with the help of CSAT provided assets. NATO sees this as a threat in the region and has therefore hired Synixe to diminish the MDF's capabilities.

Contractors must move into the MDF military island and neutralize key locations that are imperative for the MDF's operations.

These locations are: An HQ, a firing range, a vehicle depot, a comms station and some docks that are used to store boats.
