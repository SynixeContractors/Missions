Sami insurgency is growing stronger and has crossed the norwegian border.

While government is currently organizing a response, an Iran flagged ship has entered the fjord and moored in the port.
They are expected to carry weapons and possibly troops to help the insurgency. Due to the threat to civilian aviation that the finnish conflict has caused it is vital that any anti air missiles are denied.

Synixe has been contracted to try and find the heavy weapons within the shipment and dispose of them. Due to amount of time past, we are expecting that those weapons have already been distributed in the area. The most likely place is local strongpoint in the town of Helbotn but we might have to improvise and look for local information.
