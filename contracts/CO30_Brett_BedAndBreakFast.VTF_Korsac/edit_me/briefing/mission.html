An important local figure in Korsac, Olaf Pawlik, has been kidnapped by separatists, and it is feared he will be extracted to Russia very soon.

Pawlik reportedly gave shelter to a man who's car broke down in the city of Rostok, where Pawlik lives. In the morning, a car sped up to Pawlik's house, and the unknown man escorted Pawlik out of the house and into the vehicle at gunpoint. The car sped off, and it's route has been marked based on civilian reports.

A police force was dispatched to the area, but took fire from separatists forces and have had to retreat. We have been tasked with moving into the area, and securing Pawlik before it is too late.

If we are able to, document any evidence of Russian involvement in the kidnapping, as this would be a major diplomatic incident.
