Recently a CIA asset working in deep cover as a cargo pilot in Tanoa failed to check in with his handler. This asset, Ruru Naituyaga, is believed to have been capture by operating Vanguard PMC forces.

Synixe has been hired to mobilize to the island Vangaurd is currently operating from to then find and rescue Naituyaga. Intelligence has detected that a trawler registered to a Vanguard shell company is headed towards the island, so it is suspected that they intend to extract Naituyaga by sea.

Additionally, we've been asked to if possible deal with a set of mortar emplacements that Vanguard has distributed throughout the island. Intelligence suggests that there are 3 emplacements around the island.
