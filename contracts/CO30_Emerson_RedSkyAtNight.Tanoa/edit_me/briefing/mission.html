YOU CAN ADD AS MUCH AS YOU FEEL IS RELEVANT

AS A RULE OF THUMB, CONSIDER: WHO, WHAT (TASKS), WHERE, WHEN, AND WHY

IT IS HELPFUL TO INCLUDE THE ENEMY AMLCOA AND WHAT WE EXPECT OF THEM, IF KNOWN
(MOST LIKELY COURSE OF ACTION, AKA, WHAT THEY'RE DOING, HOW THEY ACT, HOW THEY'LL ACT TOWARDS US, WHAT WE KNOW, ETC)

We have been hired to provide security for the Blue Pearl industrial port due to an increasing threat from Syndikat. Due to the ongoing Syndikat situation, Daltgreen already cooperates with the local Gendarmerie to provide security to its facilities. But recent attacks have increased security needs, so we have been contracted to fill the gap.

While Syndikat activity has always been present, attacks against Daltgreen facilities have increased in recent weeks. Three weeks ago, pirates attacked and nearly sunk a Daltgreen vessel. Last week, a bomb was detonated at the Red Spring surface mine, injuring three workers.

We will be pulling a security shift at the Blue Pearl industrial port from 0400 to 0600, at which point additional Gendarmerie forces will arrive and take over security operations. We are responsible for securing the entire premises. There should be relatively few Daltgreen workers and activity during these early morning hours.

There are two Gendarmerie guard posts at either entrance to the port. There is an additional Gendarmerie guard post to the south on the road that leads to the mine.

There is an important naval shipment from the east expected to arrive at the port at 0500 and leave by 0530. We are to see to its safe arrival and departure from the AO.

Daltgreen has given us rooftop access for the office building at the port. We can use it at our own discretion.
