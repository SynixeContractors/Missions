We have been hired to provide security for the Blue Pearl industrial port due to an increasing threat from Syndikat.

While Syndikat activity has always been present, attacks against Daltgreen facilities have increased in recent times. Three weeks ago, pirates attacked a Daltgreen vessel, forcing the crew to abandon it. Last week, a bomb was detonated at the Red Spring surface mine, injuring three Daltgreen workers.

We are tasked with staffing a security shift at the Blue Pearl industrial port from 0400 to 0600. We are responsible for securing the entire premises. There should be relatively few Daltgreen workers and activity during these early morning hours.

There are two Gendarmerie guard posts at either entrance to the port. There is an additional Gendarmerie guard post to the south on the road that leads to the mine. A couple of Genarmerie sentries will be patrolling the perimeter.

At this time, Daltgreen does not find it necessary for us to sweep the whole premises for bombs. Daltgreen believes they have had enough security at the port to prevent that threat so far, unlike the surface mine. The Gendarmerie and workers on site will have the ability to reach us by radio, if someting does arise.

There is an important naval shipment approaching from the east that is expected to arrive at the port at 0500 and leave by 0530. We are to see to its safe arrival and departure from the AO.

Daltgreen has given us rooftop access for the sole office building at the port. Any door on the ground should allow us to get in by using the keypad. We are allowed to utilize the rooftop at our own discretion.
