<font color='#d81717'>ENEMY FORCES</font>
Name: Farabadi Freedom Legion
Location: Marked Target Area and across Farabad

- Lightly armored fighters that use numbers and massed fire to move against enemies. Also known to use up armored vehicles and technicals to push their enemies into CQB.

- Their control of Farabad is light, with not many areas being fully manned other than their headquarters in the center of the city, but is propelled by their so-far brutal treatment of the Shia population of the city.

Hired as security forces for VIPs. Will not come to help.

Majority of the population still lives inside the city. Allegiance is unknown due to how recently FFL has taken over, but CIVPOP shouldn't get in the way of contractor operations in the area.
