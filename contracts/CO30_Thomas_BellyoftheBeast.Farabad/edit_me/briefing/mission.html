Approx. 5 hours ago, government forces evacuated the city of Farabad due to mass killings of law enforcement and civil unrest. And approx. 2 hours ago, terrorist cells within the city culled all civilain leadership behind the rioting and quelled the civil unrest, taking control of Farabad.

This is believed to be the work of Sergei Badawi, a long-time leader of an ISIS in Syria who escaped into Farabad as US SOCOM cannot follow him easily into Takistan. He is believed to be advising the insurgents, who call themselves the Farabadi Freedom Legion (Anglicized).

Synixe Contractors had snuck into the city before the fall, but are now stuck in the middle of the enemy controlled city. However, Badawi's projected location, as well as the center of FFL operations in the city, is right next to the Contractor's safehouse and should be free of civilians. Your vehicles are located in the courtyard.

To get out, a VIP with an ION security detail has worked a deal with the Takistani government to leave a small compound on the outskirts of the city untouched in the following chaos. Contractors will move to the compound where they will be protected when the Takistani Army moves in to retake the city.
