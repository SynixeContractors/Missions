NATO have hired us to remove a problematic Russian General, who has turned rogue in the Chernarus Region. 

NATO cannot set foot on Russian soil so have hired us to bring this General to heel. 

There are several weapons and assets he could use against NATO allies.

The plan is to setup a small temporary FOB in a quiet village using fishing boats. From there will take the Airfield and clear the Town of Cherno, allowing us to setup a full base with the use of the captured small Airfield.
