The Russian Goverment have hired us to remove a problematic General, who has turned rogue in the Cherno Region. 

With the fighting in Ukraine in full swing before the winter, the Russian goverment cannot spare the resources to bring this General to heel.

The plan is to setup a small temporary FOB in a quiet village using fishing boats. From there will take the Airfield and clear the Town of Cherno, allowing us to setup a full base with the use of the captured small Airfield.
