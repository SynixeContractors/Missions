Recently achieved sale and transfers of equipment from British Armed Forces to bolster old and antiquated equipment of the republic's army have lit the fire under the long held belief of the opposition party that the country should be aligning itself with its closest neighbour not the old colonial overlord.

The opposition turned miltia have raided armories and have stolen one of the shipments from the port. Many government soldiers have gone MIA (presumed deserters). There have been shots fired at british servicemembers leaving many wounded and one KIA. The british government cannot commit more security forces to the island because of upcoming election campaign.

Synix has been contracted to help the government recover from recent setbacks.
