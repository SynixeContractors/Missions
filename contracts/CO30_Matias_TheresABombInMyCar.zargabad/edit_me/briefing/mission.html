Last night a break in occurred at Bakir Bahrami's villa near Zargabad; a local militia group paid off his previous security team and made off with Bahrami's car collection.

As such, he's hired Synixe to track down and recover his vehicles. Thanks to witness accounts we know the approximate locations of most of the vehicles; they have been marked on your maps in yellow. It has also been reported that the militia has broken into the airport with trucks carrying Jeeps.

Bahrami's collection consists of the following:
- Arcadian: Black in color, with the license plate BIG POPPA
- Jeep: White in color, with the license plate JEEPERS
- Hatchback: Blue with a livery, with the license plate TOP GOONER
- SUV: Red in color, with the license plate NOT POOR
