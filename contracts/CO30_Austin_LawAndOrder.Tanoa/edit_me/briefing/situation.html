Name: Syndikat
Location: Eastern Tanoa

Until now, Syndikat's prescense in the region has been relatively low to non-existent in previous months. Tanoa's dense jungles make their activities difficult to track. Comprised of criminials and paramilitary groups, their armaments ranges from the late 1900s to early 2000s. Furthermore, their diverse composition makes their true motives for fighting unknown. Whatever is the case, recent reports have noted their renwed strength and agressive tactics capturing towns and critical infastructure in eastern Tanoa. With news of Synixe contractor's exit from the Horizon Islands, Syndikat may have just found a new opporunity to gain some ground.
