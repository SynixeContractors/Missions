Just an hour ago, Syndikat launched a surprise offensive in eastern Tanoa. Taking advantage of our pullout from the region, Syndikat groups have taken of control of several sites including the Blue Pearl port and Red Spring mine in effort to gain control of the island.

As one of the few remaining squads in Tanoa, link up with local Gendarmerie forces and take back those sites. Local forces are planning a counter attack at 0700. Additional reaction forces are either securing other targets in the region or are enroute.

Although only a short time has passed, Syndikat has total control of the AO especially towards the port. Be wary of ambushes and roadblocks, they are likely expecting our counter attack.
