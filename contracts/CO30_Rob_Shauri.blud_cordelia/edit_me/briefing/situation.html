The RRB is a communist insurgency group that has expanded in recent years thanks to China and other CSAT aligned nations taking an interest in bringing Cambodia into their sphere of influence. RRB forces are limited to mostly 20th century weaponry however, they have acquired the services of an unknown Chinese PMC. It is presumed this PMC has access to modern weaponry and vehicles. Intelligence reports that the stolen artifacts have been relocated to a centralized location within the AO.
