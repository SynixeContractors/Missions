As part of the Ministry of the Interior's ongoing efforts to provide aid and stabilize the Drakovac region, we have been hired to deliver essential supplies to several key locations. The negative sentiment towards the LDF and government employees has led to the Ministry seeking private contractors, hoping that our presence will be less provocative.

During our operation, we will also be tasked with securing or destroying a few small caches of equipment, left behind by the last "maintenance" crews before the final military pullout. The officers were instructed to leave the caches either on the locked roof of the command building, or on the locked third floor of helicopter ATC towers. You will likely need lockpicks, or breaching explosives, to access these areas.

The situation is complex, but doing well could see us get a lot of lucrative follow-up work in the region.
