Over recent weeks Syndikat has slowly been pushing south along the eastern coast taking village after village, with the recent international support they have chosen more conventional forms of action. Taking fight to the government and inflicting heavy losses. Rumored to be taught and led by international volunteers from Europe their cohesion seems to be significantly higher then previously.

Two days ago, a failed counterattack by the gendarmes has lead to heavy casualties attacking against fortified position in southern part of Ouméré, government seeking quick progress has decided to contract Synixe to deliver strike deeper into enemy lines hoping to catch and destroy enemy supplies and support equipment.

Synixe is to push into the coastal towns, clearing out Ouméré and Luganville and to destroy suspected enemy supply depot in Luganville or Nandai. Just before we arrived one of the APC's damaged by a faulty AT mine has been repaired and transferred for use in the push.
