Location: Eastern Tanoa

Recent pushes to the south made them much formiddable enemy, having almost complete control over the northeastern part of main island allowed them to get more support from outside including weapons ammunition and volunteers from abroad. Gendarmerie was caught complexly unaware and unable to contain them due to Syndikat's recent switch to more conventional take and hold strategy. Joined by volunteers from abroad, they now posses limited number of light support assets.

Location: Moddergat Bridge

After being investing heavily into COIN tactics and weapons, they have been caught unprepared with the conventional pushes and were unable to hold key cities in eastern Tanoa. Ordered into counterattack they took heavy casualties and had to withdraw to hold choke-points. They are holding bridgehead from the island of Moddergat, but they are under pressure from probing attacks

Civilians avoid direct front area, but our push will necessarily go into calmer part of the island
