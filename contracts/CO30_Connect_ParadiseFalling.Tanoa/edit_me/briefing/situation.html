Recent pushes to the south made them much formidable enemy, having almost complete control over the northeastern part of main island allowed them to get more support from outside including weapons, ammunition and foreign volunteers. Gendarmerie was caught completly unaware and unable to contain them due to Syndikat's recent switch to more conventional take and hold strategy. Reinforced by volunteers from abroad, light support assets, and captured gendarmerie vehicles, they pose a threat that should not be underestimated.

After investing heavily into COIN tactics and weapons, they have been caught unprepared with the conventional pushes and were unable to hold key cities in eastern Tanoa. Ordered into counterattack they took heavy casualties and had to withdraw to hold choke-points. They are holding bridgehead from the island of Moddergat, but they are under pressure from probing attacks.

Civilians avoid direct front area, but our push will necessarily go into calmer part of the island.
