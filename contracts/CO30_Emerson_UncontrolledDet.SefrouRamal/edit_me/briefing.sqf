            <br/>Mission:
            <br/>
            <br/>Sometime last night, a bomb was brought onto the premises of Daltgreen's train yard at grid 035944. The bomb went unnoticed for most of the day until a Daltgreen employee decided to investigate a suspicious, empty vehicle. There, the employee discovered a large bomb sitting in the bed of the truck and Daltgreen immediately contacted us for disposal. Dealing with this threat is our initial tasking.
            <br/>
            <br/>The bomb is situated near important infrastructure and, as such, Daltgreen will not allow us to do controlled detonation on the premises. Any bombs or bomb components must be defused. Any remaining explosive material (including disarmed bombs) will need to be taken offsite and safely disposed of, as they don't want any explosive material falling into the wrong hands. Daltgreen has advised us that the old quarry to the west at grid 020945 would be an ideal location to safely detonate any remaining explosives.
            <br/>
            <br/>Security camera footage from the previous night shows the bomb being driven on site in a Daltgreen cargo truck by a Daltgreen employee. Based on the number of the truck and the time of the incident, Daltgreen suspects their employee Theodoros Manetta was the driver. Currently, Daltgreen is unsure of his whereabouts.
            <br/>
            <br/>Daltgreen has tasked us with finding and detaining Theodoros Manetta. We are to search his worker place of residence at grid 044923 for any clues as to his whereabouts or his motives. Daltgreen suspects he is still within the region as he has no contacts outside the company.
            <br/>
            <br/>Once Theodoros Manetta has been apprehended, we are to deliver him to Daltgreen at the train yard. Daltgreen will take over from there.
