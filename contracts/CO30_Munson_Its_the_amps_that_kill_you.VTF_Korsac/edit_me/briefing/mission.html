While on a training exercise in Korsac, Synixe heard shots nearby. We have now learned that Separatist's have captured a nearby Power Station and Oil Refinery and are holding them to ransom.

Being the closest assets, Synixe has been tasked with eliminating the Separatist's and restoring Power and Resources to the area.

The Separatist's are known to use hit and run tactics.
