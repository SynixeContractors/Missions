A train stopped in the town of Kamyshovo was attacked by a well armed group, and 6 weapons shipments were stolen.

The loss of these weapons could have serious consequences. The government has asked for our help in recovering the weapons, and we have agreed to help. We have been given the location of the weapons, and we are to recover them and return them to the train at the station.

All we know is that the attackers left in several vehicles, traveling north.
