An insurgent group supported with foreign weapons has been trying to gain control of South Zagoria, a region of Chernarus.

After a few small incidents, the Chernarus Republic now believes they are getting ready to strike. It is believed they will start by attacking power infrastructure, impeding the ability of Chernarus forces to respond to the insurgents.

The Chernarus Republic forces will be spread thin, and we have been hired to provide our specialist services to prevent the destruction of power distribution infrastructure. They will be focusing their forces on defending the power plant.

We are tasked with checking all Power Distribution Substations and Transformers to ensure they are operational and to disable any explosives found at the stations. One of the two transformers in Chernogorsk does not have a switch.

After the power is restored, move to to the Balota Airfield to debrief with a commander of the Chernarus Republic.
