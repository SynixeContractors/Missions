CSAT has been expanding its offensive operations in North Africa, and has been using Malden as a staging area. Many of the forces have recently been rotated to other locations, and it is believed to be vulnerable.

While still being used for some fighter jet operations, it is largely being used as a UAV base, and the garrison is small, not well equipped, and not CSAT's best service members. Our goal is to soften up their air defenses, and destroy as much equipment as possible.

We're being provided with anti-tank equipment, as well as artillery support.

The infantry garrison is weak, but the base still has a few pieces of light armor, UAVs, and one of CSAT's 护狼低位防击系统 (HLX) installations, with automated defense systems.
