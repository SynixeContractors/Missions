Summa and Eridonia are two regions of a former Soviet dependant in Eastern Europe that has fallen into a state of civil disarray for the last 7 years. NATO has been trying to stabilize the region, but is trying to avoid putting troops on the ground to avoid political backlash. Initially, NATO hired a PMC called ION Security, but they have been largely ineffective.

A bandit problem has been growing in the region, raiding the local population and old military caches. Are task is to destroy the old military caches and investigate reports of bandit activity, hopefully providing some much needed stability to the people of Summa.
