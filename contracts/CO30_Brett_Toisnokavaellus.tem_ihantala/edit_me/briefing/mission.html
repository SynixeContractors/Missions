The Finnish Armed Forces are looking to gain intel and inflict a blow on the operations of a cultist group, swaying more people from joining and causing some of their current membership to reconsider.

We'll be inserting onto the island via boat, no vehicles are available. It is believed that vehicles will also be rare on the island, due to the expense of transport. While the cultists are essentially in open rebellion, the focus is to gather intel. Mission restrictions take priority over secondary objectives.

Police Intelligence has provided us with some observations from satellite and drones:

- Confirmed to have a small fleet of trucks used for construction
- At least two armed trucks seen used in their "drills"
- They have communications equipment
- They have patrols of 6-12 people armed with light weapons
- Sites are guarded by large teams with sophisticated weapons

We are tasked with hitting 3 sites, observed to be of high importance to high-ranking members. Gather all intel at these sites.

Their leader, Valaistunut Yksi (The Enlightened One), is confirmed to be near the sites but his exact location is unknown. He has 4 elite guards and is himself well armed. If spotted, he is to be secured or eliminated.

We will be moving in at night, but the Sun will already be rising. The Enlightened One should not be on the move at this hour, but the cults does have night patrols.
