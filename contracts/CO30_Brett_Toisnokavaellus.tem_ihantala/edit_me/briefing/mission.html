Since Finland joined NATO, a small group of cultists on a Finnish island in the Baltic Sea has grown in size and power.

The Finnish Armed Forces are looking to gain intel and inflict a blow on their operations, ideally swaying more people from joining, and causing some of their current membership to reconsider their choices.

Synixe Contractors has been hired, and we'll be inserting onto the island via boat, no vehicles will be available for this mission. It is believed that vehicles will also be rare on the island, due to the expense of transporting them there. While the cultists are essentially in open rebellion against the Finnish government, we are to avoid damaging civilian infrastructure, and allow the cultists to disengage if they choose to do so. The contract focus is to gather intel. The mission restrictions take priority over secondary objectives.

Finnish Police Intelligence has provided us with some intel on the island and the cult operations. Observations by satellite and drones:

- Confirmed to have a small fleet of trucks used for construction.
- At least one armed truck seen used in "drills"
- They have communications equipment
- They often have patrols of 6-12 people, armed with light weapons
- Sites are guarded by large teams with more sophisticated weapons

We are tasked with hitting 3 site, observed to be of high importance to high-ranking members of the cult. Gather any intel or equipment you can find.

Their leader, Valaistunut Yksi (The Enlightened One), is confirmed to be near the sites, but his exact location is unknown. He is guarded by 4 elite guards, and is himself well armed. If spotted, he is to be secured or eliminated.

We will be moving in at night, but the summer Sun will already be rising. The Enlightened One should not be on the move at this hour, but the cults does have night patrols.
