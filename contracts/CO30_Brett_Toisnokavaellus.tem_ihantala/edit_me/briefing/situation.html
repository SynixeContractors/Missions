We're deploying to a Finnish island in the Baltic Sea, near Russia. The island, recently hardly populated, has been taken over by a cult backed by Russia.

Name: Russia-Backed Cultists

Formerly a fringe group, they have grown a large amount since Finland joined NATO. They are armed with a mix of modern Russian, Soviet, and civilian equipment.

The island had a small population historically, but now essentially all civilians not associated with the cult have moved off the island.
The island is populated almost entirely by cultists. They have many small villages and camps.
