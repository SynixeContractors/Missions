The Chernarussian Civil War may be a closed chapter, but peace remains elusive. A ruthless warlord, Radan Miyović, has rallied bandits and looters under his banner, escalating anti-government activity.  His forces stand accused of ethnic cleansing in the city of Bystrica.

The Czechia's BYSFOR peacekeeping mission struggles to contain the violence. To counter Miyović's growing threat, BYSFOR has contracted Synixe for a critical mission.
