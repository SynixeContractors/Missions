A BYSFOR convoy transporting vital military assets – missile and air-to-ground bombing units –  was ambushed in Bystrica. Intelligence suggests Miyović's forces are responsible and have stashed the stolen weaponry in two undisclosed locations within the city. While Miyović's ragtag militia might not be able to deploy these complex weapons systems themselves, the CDF fears his forces could extract the deadly warheads and unleash catastrophic damage. To prevent such a scenario, Synixe was contacted to help for a deniable operation.
