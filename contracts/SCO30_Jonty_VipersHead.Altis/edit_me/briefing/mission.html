The Viper, leader of the troublemaking Altian Liberation Front (ALF), is back after hiding for months. The Altian Defence Force (ADF) needs you to take him down before he unleashes another mess.

Here's the intel: ADF folks picked up some strong radio signals coming from the valley to the north of Negades. On top of that, guerilla fighters on the island are saying some leaders from the liberation army, regular folks fighting back, have gone missing in the same area. Prisoners? Accidental casualties?

Your mission's got layers. First, hit the Viper's hideout hard and fast. Shut down his communication channels too â€“ there's definitely a portable communications unit nearby that he has been using to convey orders and intelligence, so take it down. Remember, there might be innocent people caught in the crossfire. If intel suggests the posibility of hostages, get them out safely, no questions asked. Destroy any weapon supplies found. Hit hard, hit fast.
