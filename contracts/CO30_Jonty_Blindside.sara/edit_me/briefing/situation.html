The northern region of Sahrani Island is under NATO control, while the southern region is dominated by the Liberation Army. Last night, a NATO barracks was attacked by unidentified assailants. All personnel managed to evacuate, except for two sergeants who were captured while defending the transport trucks. Intelligence reports indicate that the Liberation Army infiltrated the northern island via an unguarded coastline and established a foothold in the abandoned camps on the hilltops of the Sierra Pita Valley.
