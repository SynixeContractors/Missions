Corruption and scandal during the 2025 Chadian national elections resulted in the country once again becoming de-stabilized. 

FACT (Front pour lâ€™alternance et la concorde au Tchad), having grown in size and capability over the years, took advantage of the situation and declared war on the national government. 

NATO, not willing to become involved in yet another foray into Africa, urged France to get involved to which they did. 

Since 2025, France has propped up the national government through force of arms. However, the operation quickly became a quagmire with public settlement back home turning sour to the idea of staying involved.

With France currently drawing down it's forces in theatre, Jem'heda'r Industries has looked to Synixe to rescue a number of it's workers who were abducted from the companies property around Djebel Hamra.

The PMC firm to whom had taken the initial security contract for Jem'heda'r shared with Synixe that their operators had reported fire from heavy weaponry and motar fire prior to going dark.
