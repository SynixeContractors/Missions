            <br/>
            <br/>Synixe has been hired to lay the ground work for a Chernarussian retaking of the island. We are tasked with destroying key infrastructure that would aid the russians in defending their positions.
            <br/>
            <br/>Contractors are to destroy:
            <br/>-A radar and radio tower
            <br/>-AA weaponry
            <br/>-An ammo cache
            <br/>-A fuel supply
            <br/>-A transmitter tower
            <br/>-Any vehicles that may give the russians air superiority
            <br/>
            <br/>We have been provided with aerial photos of the island as well as Stingers by the Chernarussians.
