Our client has hired us to secure Ivan Petrska. His last known region is marked on your maps.

We don't expect him to come willingly, but we need him alive.

Extraction will occur at 1400 hours, be ready. Once Ivan is secured in the civilian helicopter, you have 30 seconds before the escort leaves.

Unfortunately, we are not the only ones after him.

Good luck, Synixe Contractors.
