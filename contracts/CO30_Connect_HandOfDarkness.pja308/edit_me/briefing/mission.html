Makom's faction last week broke peace agreement between warlords, pushed into the neutral territory and captured our client's workers, key management and infrastructure.

Mr. Bouyx has managed to secure Ouaka agreement on returning to the ceasefire but Mokom has not answered any calls. Our client believes that if we do a show of force against the aggressor he will agree to return to the balanced neutral sitation in the region.

Synixe is to push into the captured territory at night and rescue the company's accountant and one of the managers. They were captured during visitations in the processing facility and town of Malazgirt.

Additionally, local contacts have said that Makom's cousin Bernard is in the area personally overseeing the operation. He is believed to be either at the local HQ organized in the oilfield in the south or at the recently fortified Makom's residence in town of Kureci. Our orders are to capture him.
