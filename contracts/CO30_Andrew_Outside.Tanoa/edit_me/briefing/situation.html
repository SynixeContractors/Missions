Name: Tanoan Law Enforcement
Location: All airbases and Comms Bravo
The local law enforcement is spread too thin and requested our help in the matter. They have asked Synixe to alleviate pressure to the five marked radio towers. Their focus is to defend Comms Bravo and to assault Comms Alpha. We are not expected to assist in their assault, just to assault the five locations marked in yellow.

Pirates have taken control of the islands of Tanoa. They've taken control of several radio communication towers. Regardless of their reason, eliminate all threats and access the laptops.
Expect the pirates to be geared with Russian grade equipment, and to have guerilla like tactics.
