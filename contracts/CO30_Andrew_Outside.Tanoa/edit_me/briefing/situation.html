Name: Tanoan Law Enforcement
Location: All areas marked in blue, mainly airbases/airports and the Blue Pearls Industrial Port.

The local law enforcement is spread too thin and requested our help in the matter. They have asked Synixe to alleviate pressure to the five marked radio towers. Their focus is to defend Comms Bravo and to assault Comms Alpha. We are not expected to assist in their assault, just to assault the five locations marked in yellow.
