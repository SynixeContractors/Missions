Welcome to Aliabad. Aliabad has been recently linked to terrorism in that cells are believed to be in the region. Al-Qaeda personnel have been crossing the borders of the United States of America, Canada, Great Britain, France, and Germany. These world powers have banded together to pool resources to find out any similarities with their recent "guests" coming in. The results brought them to the Aliabad region. It has resulted in the CIA infiltrating the area and "setting up shop" to begin exercises.

The CIA tends to operate in the covert of darkness and shadow. They do not like to be associated directly, but rather have others do their work for them. The CIA have been established here for about two weeks now. There is a local PMC group (ION PMC) protecting the inner grounds, with hired locals acting as the outer perimeter security. With the CIA outsourcing their military prowness, Synixe have been hired to assist and infilitrate any taskings the CIA have. These tasks would most likely be reconnaissance, high value target execution or extraction, intel seizure, and tasks of this nature.

The CIA will deny any involvement in any scenarios. We are expected to keep their whereabouts a secret, and even them providing us intel will be scarce. This relationship is more favorable for them. Synixe provides information in exchange for payment. We are the only known foreign players in the region with both the CIA and ION PMC hidden behind their walls.

Terrain considerations: Aliabad is known for their desert along a coastline. With spaced out villages and towns, the terrain is vast and open.

Name: Tanoan Law Enforcement
Location: All airbases and Comms Bravo
The local law enforcement is spread too thin and requested our help in the matter. They have asked Synixe to alleviate pressure to the five marked radio towers. Their focus is to defend Comms Bravo and to assault Comms Alpha. We are not expected to assist in their assault, just to assault the five locations marked in yellow.
