A CSAT backed militia is trying to gain power in the region, and CSAT has recently given them some new toys.

Thanks to information from someone with cold feet, we know the militia has received 2 MLRS systems from CSAT, and we know where they currently are.

We also know that a CSAT officer personally delivered the MLRS systems, and is now at a secondary location. Unfortunately, we don't know the location, but we do know his personal communications device was active just before 0245 hours.

As the closest force able to deploy on short notice, we have been hired to take out the MLRS systems, and implicate CSAT in the process.
