Gunkizli is a relatively remote region in Eastern Europe, with many small towns. It has a long history of simmering tensions, especially as Russia and CSAT look to expand their influence in the region. The military has not been able to keep up staffing in the region, and was unprepared for the recent escalation. Many military sites sit abandoned, used by locals, or have been taken over by militias.
