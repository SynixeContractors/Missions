A raid was carried out this morning by what is believed to be an extremist group, a car bomb was used to destroy a construction site, injuring and killing many of the workers.

The government of Prilivsko has issued a contract for the elimination of said group in the given area of operations.

Suspicious movements in the regions have lead intelligence reports of there being approximately four garrison sites with supply caches in them, although their location has not been pinpointed as of now.

Contractors have been tasked to head over to the attack site and investigate leads to where these sites may be, and once found, to eliminate all insurgent units and destroy all four supply cache sites.
