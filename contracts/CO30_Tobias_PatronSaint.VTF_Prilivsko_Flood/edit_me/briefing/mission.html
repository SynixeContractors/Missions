After weeks of continuous rainfall, Prilivsko has been at risk for extreme flooding. Yesterday, the dykes broke. Local law enforcement was unable to evacuate all the civilians in the area.

IDAP preemptively set up an aid station to help with relief effots, but are unable to reach all those in need of help. 

The USS Freedom deployed a UAV to help observe and provide assitance with information gathering for local law enforcement. However, the UAV suffered a catastrophic malfunction after a lightning strike; causing it to crash land in the DMZ.

Prilivsko is a demilitarized zone in the Green Sea region, acting as a buffer between Chernarus and Russia. As per international agreements, a foreign third-party oversees the security of the region. The foreign third-party in question is Belarus, a junior member of CSAT.

Synixe has been hired to destroy the wreckage of the crashed UAV.

This is a terribly embarrassing situation for NATO that could potentially lead to international repurcussions if not dealt with discretely.
