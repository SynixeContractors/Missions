Shapur, a once desolate desert, has been growing in recent times. Taliban forces have infiltrated the region and began recruiting new members while killing any who oppose. Which brings us to today.

We have been called in as an outside force to help assist with neutralizing Taliban threats. A military base to the south has been evacuated with constant gunfire. Casualties amounted far higher than expected, and the call was made to evacuate.

Synixe has been called upon to scout the immediate surrounding areas marked on map, eliminate any threats, and relieve the pressure on that military base.
