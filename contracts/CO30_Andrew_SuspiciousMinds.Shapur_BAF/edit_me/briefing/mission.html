Shapur, a once desolate desert, has been growing in recent times. Taliban forces have infilitrated and began recruiting new members while killing any of those who oppose. Which brings us to today.
We have been called in as an outside force to help assist with neutralizing Taliban threats. A military base to the south has been evacuated with constant gunfire. Casualities amounted far higher than expected, and the call was made evacuate.
Synixe has been called upon to check the immediate surrounding areas, marked on map, to scout the areas, eliminate any threats, and relieve the pressure on that military base.
