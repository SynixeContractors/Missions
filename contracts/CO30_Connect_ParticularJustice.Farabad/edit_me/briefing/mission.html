Over past months UT influence has been growing, there have been multiple terrorist attack staged on local markets that left many people wounded. Mines in the valley have been hit by small arms and sporadic mortar fire. Many mine workers have quit over safety concerns, even after Norox has hired ION to protect the mining equipment.

Since then attacks only intensified. The company has decided to contract Synixe to push UT out of the nearby hills and provide a safety buffer. One of the captured members has divulged information that militants have multiple camps set up in mountains using local infrastructure and terrain. ION has checked out one of the locations pointed out by the captive but found only a previous camping location.

Synixe is to find the camps and destroy the weapon caches.
