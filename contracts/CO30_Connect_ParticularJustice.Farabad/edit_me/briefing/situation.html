After years of low activity the central Asian parts of the group have become more active. Recruiting from shunned minority groups, partially supported by the Taliban government, they've been able to acquire weapons left behind from American occupation of Afghanistan as well as smuggled in equipment from China. Local group wants to push government to abolish its secular constitution and join federation of similar movements across the region.
