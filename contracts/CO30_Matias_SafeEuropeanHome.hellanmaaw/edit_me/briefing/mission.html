During Na Trioblóidí a young gunsmith by the name of Michael Murphy became notorious for providing weapons of impecable quality to the IRA, once the Good Friday Agreement took place Murphy went disappeared of the face of the earth. However, his weapons kept appearing all over the globe in several conflicts and massacres, leading to him bein wanted by both the British government and INTERPOL.

Recently a Vanguard PMC fireteam were found to be carrying weapons made by Murphy and thanks to SIGINT and HUMINT the British have been able to determine that Murphy is operating out of Hellanmaa.

Synixe has therefore been contracted to find Murphy and execute a kill or capture order. Thanks to the word of civlians we know that Vanguard has extensive logistical operations on the Eastern side of the region, which leads us to believe that Murphy is probably in that area overseeing the manufacturing and assembly of weapons.

Alternatively contractors could mount an assault on the Vanguard F.O.B, which is established in the Jankos Industrial Area, and attempt to find any information on Murphy's whereabouts.

Contractors have also been provided with a computer generate photo that recreates what Murphy would look like in the present day based of photos of his younger self.
