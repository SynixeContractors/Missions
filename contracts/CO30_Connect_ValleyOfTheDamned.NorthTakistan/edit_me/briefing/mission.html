During recent push of the Northern Alliance, AFP's war correspondent and his cameraman have been captured during mass surrender in town of Kushkak.

They have demanded that the press agency publish their manifesto to the world. The agency partners have obliged but the group demanded a live show that had to be cut off midway through.

Pierre Louette has been executed on internet livestream just 30 minutes ago and threat that Andrew will be executed at 16:30 local time, with demands to resume broadcast. The location was in some kind of walled complex near the river, we are trying to get fix on that location. We have very limited intel going in, few of the suspected and known enemy locations have been marked on map.

Synixe has been contracted to rescue the journalist and bring back the body of his cameraman.
