Synixe has been hired by NATO to secure and transport a CSAT Y-32. This craft, along with a large weapons shipment, has recently been purchased by the Virolahati Peoples Republic (VPR). The VPR is looking to gain membership into CSAT, and it is hoped the loss of these assets will deteriorate relations between the two. Meanwhile, the Kansan Vapausliike, a NATO created insurgent group, will provide a cover for Synixe in the form of operations in and around Virojoki. OPFOR numbers and operations within Virojoki are numerous and extensive.
