After years of relative stability following the 3rd Sudanese Civil War, last year's extreme drought has left tens of thousands to starve. Transitional government has been blamed for prioritizing rebuild only in areas that strongly support it in the east. Resulting unrest has moved the army to once again revolt and stage a successful coup ahead of upcoming elections. The populace feeling betrayed, decided to act and took up arms forming Sudanese Public Movement (SPM)
