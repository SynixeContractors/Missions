Bakri Hasan Saleh - a Sudanese general and key member of a military junta that was the most public supporter of formation of another transitional government and international oversight - has been labeled a traitor by the state and he only barely escaped capture.

With his security detail, he was caught between the rock and a hard place. His compound was under fire from both sides yesterday, so the rescue operation needs to take place now, under the cover of darkness.

Synixe has been contracted to extract VIP from his compound and airlift him outside the country.
