Summa has had a recent influx of drugs and contraband in and out of the city. We are being called upon to assist with locating the drug den.
Law enforcement officials have found an overturned Kamaz truck that was carrying drugs and money. It is marked in the red area marker. Law Enforcement officials have begun to move in to secure that area. We have an expectation that a similar truck is in the region, delivering or picking up supplies and possibly bringing them elsewhere. Do what you can to sniff out the supply and the demand.
