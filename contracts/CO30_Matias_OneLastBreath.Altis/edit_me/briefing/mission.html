For the past five months a civil war has been raging in Altis. The AAF, which are protecting the ruling government, have been fighting the FIA after a failed coup attempt.

This conflict is about to come to an end, with the AAF having pushed the FIA to Oreokastro and the surrounding mountains; both sides know all it takes is for one final assault for it all to end and that is what the AAF intend to do.

However due to a lack in manpower caused by peace keeping in unruly towns, the AAF have hired Synixe to deliver the supplies needed for a final assault.

Contractors are being tasked with delivering supplies to FOB Ares and Outposts Boreas, Chronos and Dionysus. Additionally we are being tasked with clearing Landing Point Eros and delivering supplies there so that an SF team can neutralize enemy assets in Thronos when the assault starts.

Due to the AAF's worry that we may clue the FIA off that an attacl is near, we have been prohibited from using any aerial assets wether they are helicopters or UAVs.
