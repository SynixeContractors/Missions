The island of Porto have been seized by a crime organization that has been causing havoc for decades. They have occupied the island by force. This hostile takeover has occurred in the last 24 hours, and we are the Quick Reaction Force to take it back.
We anticipate large numbers of enemies in the area, with zero civilians. Anyone in the area during the takeover have either escaped or anticipated dead. The crime organization have made outrageous demands... so their demands will be met with brute force. 
From the bare basic intel provided, the hostile force has torched much of the assets there. They are anticipated to have perhaps one armed truck, but nothing more. There true power and strength comes from their numbers. Proceed accordingly.
