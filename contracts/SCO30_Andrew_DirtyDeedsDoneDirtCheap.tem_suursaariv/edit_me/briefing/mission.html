Gang members have become a real menance to the newly elected mayor of Suursaari. The mayor has vowed to put an end to their illegal activities once elected. Now elected, he is in fear for his life and has called upon the assistance of Synixe. He is planning to meet with diplomats from other nations to review the information he has on these illicit groups. 
He recently had an issue in his security. Yesterday, a member of his security team was discovered with Pro Cartel propoganda. That member was arrested and questioned, but nothing has come up just yet. This is where Synixe arrives.
We are paid to be his armed security tranport. The mayor has left his home on the mainland and is now on a secluded island. We are to pick him up from Theseus protection, bring him to his meeting where Vanguard are already stationed, and then to back the mayor to the pickup island. We will be meeting another PMC group upon the arrival of the pickup on his island. The pickup point is marked with a blue start marker (to the south), and the meeting point is marked with a blue flag marker (northern part of the mainland).

We have been provided boats for this mission to remain low profile and with the fear of the cartel having capabilities of AA.
