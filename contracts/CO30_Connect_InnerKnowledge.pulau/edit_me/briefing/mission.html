Two weeks ago a civilian plane from Pyongyang landed on the island filled to the brim with North Korean soldiers. They have quickly overwhelmed the airport's security, and while guiding transport planes with the rest of the airlanding force, they pushed and overwhelmed a small Dutch garrison that surrendered with only one soldier heavily wounded.

Due to its status as an overseas territory of the Netherlands, NATO has responded that Article 5 does not apply, and neither does the EU's Common Security and Defense Policy, and vowed to instead support a UN resolution. Feeling strong in its position, North Korea decided to release the interned soldiers and boarded them on a flight to Singapore.

The weakened and isolated parliament has not yet decided on a response, but a research mission from a Dutch university has not been heard from yet. Our clients want us to recover the mission and its results. The research station was situated in the middle of the island, with accommodation being based in the towns of Tabako and Kolaka. Synixe will be inserting on boats and may have to requisition civilian transport on the island.

The island is under curfew and without access to communications. Pictures released by the North Korean government show a partial lockdown and patrols in the streets. Yesterday, satellite imagery showed a North Korean amphibious assault ship unloading armored vehicles. Troop movements seem to mostly be contained to the island's settlements.
