Name: Al-Qaeda
Al-Qaeda is a pan-Islamuist militant organization led by the Sunni Jihadists. Their soul purpose is for a global Islamist revolution; to unite the world in their Muslim beliefs and the Islamic state of Caliphate.
The world is on red alert with members of their organization sprouting in different countries across the world. These members believe us to be infidels, and are part of a war against the Muslim religion. They will stop at nothing to remove us from their lands. Al-Qaeda are known to have access to Russian and some American firearms and gear. When all else fails, they will take their own life in the name of Allah if you will be taken with them. Al-Qaeda are also known for guerilla tactics and power by numbers rather than technology.
Al-Qaeda can be anywhere in the region, so it is important to be mindful of where you are and where you step. Al-Qaeda does not know about CIA's occupancy, but they are familiar with our presence. They will begin to try to find out location as soon as possible, and even the CIA's if they became aware of their presence.
They use a myriad of vehicles and are known to have access to tanks and helicopters. Previous occupancies and arms dealers grant Al-Qaeda the possible access to U.S., NATO, and Russian grade military gear.
