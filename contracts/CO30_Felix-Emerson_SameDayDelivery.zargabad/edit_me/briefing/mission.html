The situation in greater Takistan is tense, and many locals have begun to arm themselves with surplus equipment to defend themselves and their homes after recent pullouts. IDAP has entered the scene in an attempt to help out those in need by providing food and medical supplies.

Recent conflict has left behind remnants of war across many of the fields and mountains of the region, all parties present are advised to stick to roads and urban areas in order to avoid unexploded ordnance. Additionally, the terrain is rugged and will hinder vehicle performance.
