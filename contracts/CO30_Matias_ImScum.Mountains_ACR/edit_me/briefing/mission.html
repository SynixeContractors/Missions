Recently the Taliban conducted a raid on a Takistani military base in the outskirts of Jilavur. They burnt it to the ground and stole a shipment of weapons provided by NATO.

As a result Synixe has been hired to find where the attackers went and recover the stolen weapons. Unfortunately due to the fire the inventory log of the base has been lost so we have no way of knowing how many boxes were; assume one of each possible type.

Thanks to the fact that Takistani checkpoints and base have seen no Taliban movement go past them, we have an idea of where they fled after the attack.
