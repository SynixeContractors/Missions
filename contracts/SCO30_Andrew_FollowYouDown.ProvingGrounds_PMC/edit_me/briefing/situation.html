A bloody conflict has us going to a proving ground to show our metal as a third party in a Takistani Military - Taliban war.

Takistani Government

Recovering from a full scale retreat, the Takistani Military has vacated the area. We are being hired to go into no man's land territory and defuse explosives so they don't have civilian casualities any longer. A complete and successful mission will indicate either a larger payout, or future missions... but that is to be determined.

The Taliban

The Taliban are well known in these parts. They are conflicting with the local government and military, and are seen as the aggressor in this region. We are informed that there may be lingering forces out and about. They are stocked with their typical armaments, and potentially a technical or two. It is unknown if they are armed.

The Takistani Military
The Takistani Military has called for a full scale retreat. You may seen some lingering forces potentially... but it is highly unlikely that they are here on their own volition. 

<font color='#993399'>CIVILIAN CONSIDERATIONS</font>
Civilians are present in the area. They are not necessarily seen as a threat, but we should be mindful of them if we see any with backpacks or any trying to take explosive devices. The more we uncover, the more in favor the Takistani Government may be with us for future missions.
