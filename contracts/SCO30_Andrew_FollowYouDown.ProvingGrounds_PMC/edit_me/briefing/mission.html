In the western provinces of Takistan, we are employed by the Takistani Government to go and clear several UXOs near a large crater of a previous airstrike. The conflict has supposedly passed. Takistani forces withdrew and executed a bombing run to mask their retreat. In the aftermath, there are several issues that have transpired. 

Firstly, these UXOs are near a water source that is getting in the water table there. This raises a real risk to the environment and civilians.
Furthermore, civilians are dying being in the vicinity of the crater. They are dying just crossing into the area. Some are stepping on these UXOs and losing limbs or worse. Some civilians are going into the crater searching for scrap metal or even the explosive devices. Which brings us to the third issue.
Civilians are taking the UXOs. It is unknown as to what is happening with them but if you locate any civilians with them or any explosive caches, you are tasked with denotating them or recovering them. Choice is your's.

The Takistani Military have recovered some civilians with backpacks carrying explosives during their retreat. It has been relayed that it is safe to assume that if a civilian has a backpack, they're carrying something other than their groceries. 

There are two zones. An outer yellow zone indicates the area where the airstrike commenced. This is the most probable area where you may encounter explosives. The inner red zone is the area in which we are being tasked with clearing as it directly effects the water source. If both zones are entirely cleared of mines, Takistani Officials will consider either a larger payout or future contracts, though it is to be determined.

The Takistani Government has supplied us a Little Bird as we need to fly into the area to begin our mission. We are located southwest of the region and our objective. It is unknown of the AA capabilities of the Taliban in the region, but they did state that previously there was some MANPADs used against them, though not many.
