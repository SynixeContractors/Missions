An unknown force has been making incursions into northern Norway and setting up unknown devices.

The Norwegian Government has contracted Synixe to eliminate any forces currently in the area, and photograph then destroy any devices found.

We've landed at a small dual purpose highway / airstrip, 3 offroads and 2 littlebirds are waiting for us.
