A Tanoan insurgency has been influencing a local movement in one of the islands within the Tanoan province.

Government officials, police, and civilians have been reporting sightings of insurgent forces across the island. Synixe has been provided with somewhat reliable geographical information of where these insurgents most commonly operate. There might be anywhere from one to two areas of enemy presence within each one of the areas of influence.

The insurgents might have gained some of the local's support, which may cause them to be unsupportive, obstructive, or even harmful towards contractors. The insurgency has been stealing food and weapons and reposessing them for their supporters on the island.

Synixe has been contracted to seek out any insurgent forces within the area of operations and either capture or eliminate them.
