Name: NATO
Location: Regional Command – Unspecified
NATO is covertly contracting Synixe to conduct operations they cannot publicly claim.  Their motive is to curtail Russian influence without escalating into overt conflict.

Name: Raven Security
Location: Shapur industrial sites, airfield, and surrounding patrol zones
Raven Security is equipped with modern Russian firearms (AK-12 variants, PKP machine guns, suppressed marksman rifles), armored MRAPs, and access to helicopters. They operate similarly to Russian SOF-adjacent PMCs: disciplined, tactically capable, and politically deniable. Their mission is to secure and defend Russian interests in the region while maintaining production output.

Name: Shapur Civilian Population
Location: Worker towns and small settlements
Civilians are limited to worker housing near major facilities. They have no allegiance to Raven Security but may be under their control. Local laws are effectively suspended under PMC occupation; however, civilian casualties would severely undermine NATO’s strategic aims and Synixe’s contract integrity.
