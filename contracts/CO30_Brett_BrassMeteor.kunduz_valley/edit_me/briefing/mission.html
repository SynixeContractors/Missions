The overwhelmed Karzeghistani military has requested our assistance in moving supplied to its battered outposts, and securing transporting a very important VIP.

Local terrorist forces have been attacking civilians and Karzeghistani positions in the AO, and have recently aquired 8x mortar tubes from at ambushed Karzeghistani convoy.

Reinforcing the Karzeghistani positions and destroying or recovering the mortars will go a long way to stablize civilian life in the region.
