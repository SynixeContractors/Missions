Six hours ago the island of Utes was officially lost to a group of separatists intent on creating a new government in Chernarus. Obviously the acting government does not want that to happen and have hired Synixe to retake the military facilities in the island.

Therefore contractors must mobilize to the island of Utes and secure all military facilites which include:
- Airfield
- Vehicle Depot
- Barracks
- Northern Base
