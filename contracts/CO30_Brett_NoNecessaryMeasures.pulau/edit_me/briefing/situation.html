CSAT expansion in the Pacific has been increasing at a fast pace.

Small island nations have been turning to CSAT for trade and protection treaties, turning away from the West.

Pulau has been a long time ally of the West, and has been a key strategic location for the West in the Pacific.

Despite the opinion of the islanders to remain neutral after the US removed troops from the island 4 years ago, their President has finalized a deal with CSAT, and their forces have moved into former US bases on the island.

The treaty gave CSAT the power to construct a new facility in Pulau, and this has been a breaking point for the islanders.

A group of rebels has begun a guerrilla war against CSAT forces.
