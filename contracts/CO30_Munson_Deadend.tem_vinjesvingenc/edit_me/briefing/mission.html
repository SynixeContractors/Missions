The Norwegian government has hired us to deal with a group of Pro-Russian Separatists that have seized an FOB and an experimental T-100 tank. The government is wary of sending in their own troops and giving the Separatists the publicity they so badly want.

We need to put down this little rebellion quickly and quietly and restore order to this blocked off region.

Here is a list of assets that were at the FOB at the time the Separatists took control;
- T-100
- BMP-100
- BM-2 Stalker
- MI-53 (Attack Helicopter)
- Various other vehicles, mostly transport

It is advised to bring a lot of AT/AA to deal with these threats.
