The Norway government have hired us to deal with a group of pro-Russian Separatists that have seized an FOB and an experimental T-100 tank. The Norway government are wary of sending in their own troops and giving the Separatists the publicity they so badly want.
We need to put down this little rebellion quickly and quietly and restore order to this blocked off region.
Here is a list of assets that were at the FOB at the time the Separatists took control;
T-100
BMP-100
BM-2 Stalker
MI-53 (Attack Helicopter)
and various other vehicles mostly transport.

I Would suggest you bring a-lot of AT/AA to deal with these threats.
