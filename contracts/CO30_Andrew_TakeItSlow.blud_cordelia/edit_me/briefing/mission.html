The local government have been surveilling a religious, born again, militant group that is stationed deep in the woods. They seem to have been collecting information and devising some sort of future plan. We have been called upon to figure out the what. Recover whatever you can find and carry and bring it back to base, while clearing out the areas marked on your maps.
We are approaching their neck of the woods. The jungle is thick and the terrain is unknown. This doesn't favor us in the slightest so take it slow and proceed with caution.
The government has provided you a Little Bird to help you in your endeavors. Good luck.
