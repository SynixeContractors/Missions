            <br/>Synixe has been hired by the boards of the companies to which the men belong to act as a rescue force. We are tasked with finding the wreck and brigning any survivors back to our F.O.B. Theseus Inc was hired to provide bodyguards for the passengers and they have also asked us to bring their people back.
