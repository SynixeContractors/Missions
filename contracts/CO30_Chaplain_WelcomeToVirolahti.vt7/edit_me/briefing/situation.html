Name: Scavs
Location: INSERT LOCATION(S) IF KNOWN

Scavs are loosely organized bands of armed civilians, criminals, and deserters who prey on conflict zones for survival and profit. They are opportunistic and unpredictable, scavenging weapons, food, and supplies from ruins, battlefields, and ambushed convoys.

They lack formal training but compensate with sheer numbers, local knowledge, and ruthlessness. Scavs are driven by desperation, greed, or simple lawlessness, making them as dangerous to civilians as they are to professional soldiers
