An unknown force has been making incursions into northern Norway and setting up unknown devices.

They've recently setup a device in the town of Ulvik, and reportedly have taken civilian hostages.

At this time, the enemy doesn't seem to know we're aware of their presence in Ulvik.

We've landed at a small dual purpose highway / airstrip, 3 offroads are waiting for us.
