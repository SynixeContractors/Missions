9 years ago, four 19 year olds and one 20 year old, 3 from Drovak, two local, all of them taking a gap year to travel before school, were brutally murdered by Max Burke.

The travelers were moving via Stubbhult's waterways to camp throughout the region, and that night had set up camp on the bank of the river opposite of Burke's manor.

Around 3 AM, Burke killed 2 of them outside of their tents while they were out for a walk, and then proceeded to enter the tents, killing two more of the travelers. He then took the remaining traveler hostage, and held her captive in his manor for over 48 hours, before she died of her wounds. Burke himself took part in the search operation looking for her, but eventually K9 units were able to trace the scent to Burke's manor, where they found the last traveler, who byt that time had passed away from her injuries. Only the 2 bodies in the tents and the one in the manor were found, as the body of the first two victims were washed away by the river and never found. Burke was charged with 3 counts of second degree murder, and 1 count of criminally impeding a law enforcement operation.

During the trial, Burke's defense team argued that he was mentally unstable, and Burke claimed earlier in the evening that the travelers had provoked and mocked him while trespassing on his property, although no evidence of trespassing was ever found. Burke had no prior history of violence, but had been living in reclusion since the passing of his wife 13 years prior.

Burke served 19 months in prison before being quietly allowed to return to his manor under house arrest, where he has remained since.

As part of recent trade and weapons negotiation between Stubbhult and Drovak, Drovak has requested the extradition of Max Burke, where he would face charges for the murder of one of the Drovak citizens, who's body was never recovered. The recent attention back to Max Burke has caused his house arrest to become a security concern, and Stubbhult has agreed to the extradition in order to finalize the deals with Drovak.
