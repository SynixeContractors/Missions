Name: Ättens Väktare
Location: On and around Stora Färgen

Ättens Väktare has found itself a welcome home to many of Europe's radicals, specifically those with white nationlist leanings. Many of their ranks have prior military experience
in the nations of Europe, primarily the Bundeswehr, Bundesheer, Forsvaret, and Wojsko Polskie. With the proceeds from their drug trafficking, they have been able to arm them selves with 
modern weaponry and some light vehicles. They have also recently purchased a small wing of rotary craft, some of which may be armed. Synixe can expect the majority of the groups forces to be centered
around the area's ports and airfields.

The armed forces of the nation are tied up elsewhere handling the insurgency. Do not expect much, if any, reinforcements from their forces in the AO.
