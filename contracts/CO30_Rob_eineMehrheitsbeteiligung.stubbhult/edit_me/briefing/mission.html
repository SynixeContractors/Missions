Synixe has been contracted by the Folkrepubliken Svea to aid them in their fight against the Ättens Väktare, an insurgency group which has been unrelating in their attacks on the national government. Ättens Väktare has fueled their insurgency through creating a sophisiticated drug production and distribution system. Western and eastern european nations have recorded record levels of illegal narcotics trafficked within their borders due to this epidemic. While the national government deals with the group elsewhere, Synixe will deploy to the AO and destroy Ättens Väktare's drug empire. The National government has also asked that Synixe destroy the group's rotary air-wing, along with a recently arrived arms shipment, though the drugs are the primary objective.
