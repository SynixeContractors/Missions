Two IDAP workers that were running medical operations in Tanoa's isolated villages have gone missing under mysterious circumstances.

We have been contracted by the Tanoan Government to investigate the disappearance of these two workers, and to secure them.

We have been given supplies that need to be delivered to 5 different villages, by giving them their supplies, they may be willing to give us information.
