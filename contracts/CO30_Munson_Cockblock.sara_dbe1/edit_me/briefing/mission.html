The police on Sahrani ran a operation against local Pirates and recovered 24kg (blocks) of cocaine. Street value $2 million. 

The Mayor who is up for re-election this year, decided to hold a press conference for the good publicty. The Pirates learning the location of the siezed goods from the Press conference, made an attack on the port of Corazol.

The pirates have killed most the police on this island and we've been called in to reslove the situation. 

The port town of Corazol has been cut off with ROADBLOCKS and the Priates have had overnight to dig in and fortify buildings.
