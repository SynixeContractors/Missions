The Sefrou-Ramal region is in constant conflict, with a civil war in its midst. The UNA have arrived to try to promote peace and stability. Things were going well until the recent sandstorm that caused major issues. Since then, activity has picked up. We're only getting paid for the radio towers, but we can decide to be heroes if we want to go above and beyond.

UNA Peacekeepers

The UNA, previously dealing with us, feel that we can adequately get the tasking done. They are seen as the stability in the region. A peacekeeping force in nature, there job is to leave the region better than it was found.

Tura Militants

Tura Militants are the disruptive force in the area. Constantly attacking in guerilla tactics, these militants are trying to disrupt every day functions of the UNA by killing and looting. Their goal is simple to rid the "invaders" from their home while gaining something in return.
This force is using wearing turbins and walking with Eastern World weaponry. They may have access to technicals, static emplacements, and anything they could scavenge from the UNA. The UNA claims there are no records of anything being missing from their arsenal however.
