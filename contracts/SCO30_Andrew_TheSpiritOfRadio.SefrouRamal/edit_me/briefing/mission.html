Sefrou-Ramal recently had a sandstorm, causing major issues with infrastructure and communications. There was a thought that the issues were resolved but the radio towers have still been acting up.

The UNA is requesting our assistance in going throughout the Sefrou-Ramal Region to repair and turn on the radio towers once again.
