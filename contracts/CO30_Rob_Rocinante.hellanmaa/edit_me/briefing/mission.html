Synixe has been hired by Donnager-Kwik (DK) Industries to re-take a number of their sites in the hottly disputed Hellanmaa region. Last month, a criminal collective over ran their steel and refining plants. While Synixe was contracted early on by DK, our timeline for arrival has been sped up due to the collective threatening to blow the plants should their demands not be met. DK wishes fo rus to reclaim their sites, defuse the explosives, and retrieve their fleet of vehicles.
