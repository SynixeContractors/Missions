The Serrano Cartel, experts in international drug and human trafficking, have long headed their operations from Sahrani, although very little physical operations have been conducted on the island. The Sahrani National Police, long innefective due to corruption, have recently been reformed and after two years, attempted to arrest El√≠as Serrano, the cartel's leader.

Unfortunate for the police, the cartel was much more prepared than anticipated, with many mercenaries and cartel members ready to defend Serrano. The police were quickly overwhelmed, and the cartel has since fortified their position in the North West corner of Ortego.

It is expected that a cartel extraction team is on the way with plans to extract Serrano from Sahrani. We have been contracted to prevent his escape and to secure him for the Sahrani National Police. The police have set up roadblocks north and south of Ortego, but they are not prepared for a full assault on the cartel's position.
