Three days ago a chapter of the Sons of Coming Dawn have taken control over the northeastern island of Gull Archipelago, and have burned down Imaska Radar Station and seized its assets. Among the assets were two H215 transport helicopters, one target acquisition radar, two SAM launchers, Wiesel mounted with Stinger missiles and SU-100 in state of disrepair. Synixe has been contracted by the manufacturer to destroy the newly delivered surface to air missile battery due to severe risk to the nearby wind corridor used by civilian aviation. Wrecks of both helicopters remain on base among the rubble but other assets remain unaccounted for.

Yesterday with the arrival of Josonese transport plane and announcement of transfer of arms and training to the militia group, the situation became more dangerous. Synixe is to destroy any found weapon shipments. As of now client believes they haven't yet been moved from the airfield to militia strongpoint of La Mera.

Friendly contact on the ground, a local used car salesman, offered help with transportation and intelligence. He has since gone dark and the pictures he shared before, unfortunately did not possess any EXIF data and are of poor quality. The government wishes for him to be extracted. João Almeida has dragon hand tattoos, ear piercings and has great affinity for golden jewelry.
