CSAT has began destabilizing the island of Sahrani. Fueled by the desire to have a forward base for their air force, it is believed that the Republic of Iran is pouring money into militia groups on the island which have began taking towns as their new operating bases.

In addition, NATO observation posts have began to recieve radar emissions from an Iranian search radar utilized by their modern air-defense systems. NATO believes that CSAT has set up an S400 Air Defense system east of the town of Everon, which is a direct threat to the Republic of Sahrani and the NATO relief flights they are dependent on.
