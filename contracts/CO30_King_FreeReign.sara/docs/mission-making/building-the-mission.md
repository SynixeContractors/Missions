# Building the Mission

Creating the contents of the mission is a nuanced process. There are many different
elements that can be included in a mission, and many different ways to use them.

## The Basics

Every mission should contain a clear direction for the players to move in. It
does not need to be exhaustive, but the players need to be able to easily
understand the premise of the mission, and what they need to do to complete it.

Examples include:

- Go to X and search for intel about Y.
- Go to X and destroy Y.
- Search the area for X and bring it back to base.
- Someone went missing around X, go find them.

## The Goal of Mission Making

The goal of mission making is to create a fun and engaging experience for the players.

A mission should be challenging, engaging, and rewarding. It should never be
intentionally frustrating, tedious, or punishing.

The mission should be difficult enough that the players need to work together
to complete it, but not so difficult that they are unable to complete it.
Mission failures should be the result of the players' actions, not the mission maker's.

## Avoiding Rails

A mission should not be a linear experience. The players should be able to choose
how they want to approach the mission, and the mission should be able to adapt
to their choices. Triggers should be used to react to the players' actions, not
to force the players to do something.

Triggers should almost never be chained together, the conditions should be set
up with the minimal amount of "gatekeeping" possible.

If you find yourself using a lot of triggers to force the players to do
something, you should consider reworking the mission to allow the players
to make their own choices.

Dynamic AI modules are preferred over predefined routes and waypoints. They
allow the AI to react to the players' actions, and can be used to create a
more dynamic experience. Players should not be able to predict where the
AI will be, or what they will do. Players shouldn't feel like they have
"missed out" on something because they didn't do it the "right" way, as
there is no "right" way to do complete a mission.
