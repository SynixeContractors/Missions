# Mission Types

There are several different types of missions that can be created for
Synixe Contractors. Each mission type has its own unique requirements.

| Mission Type | TAG | Persistent |
|--------------|-----|------------|
| Contract     | CO  | Yes        |
| Subcontract  | SCO | Yes        |
| Campaign     | CCO | Yes        |
| Training     | TRA | Read Only  |
| Special      | SPC | No         |

## Contracts (CO)

Our main mission type. Contracts are the bread and butter of
Synixe Contractors. They are the most common mission type, and what you
will be making most of the time.

## Sub-Contracts (SCO)

Sub-Contracts are smaller missions that are played outside of the
regularly scheduled contracts.

## Campaign-Contracts (CCO)

Campaign-Contracts are contracts that are part of a larger campaign.
Creating a campaign is a very involved process, and requires additional
information and explicit approval from Staff before it can be created.

## Training (TRA)

Training missions are specially designed training missions that teach a
specific skill or set of skills. We have our main training mission that
is always running on the training server. It is unlikely that you will
be making training missions. It is preferred that you use the main training
mission, and if you need to make a training mission, you should contact Staff first.

## Special (SPC)

Special missions are missions that are not part of our Synixe Contractors "lore".
They do not use our persistent systems, and can be any faction doing anything.
These are the least common mission type, and are usually used for special events.
