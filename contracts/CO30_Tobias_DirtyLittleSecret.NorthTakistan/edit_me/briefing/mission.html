The CIA, operating through its front company Greybridge Solutions, has deployed Synixe to locate and neutralize Abu Tariq al-Muhandis—a bomb maker whose activities threaten to reignite full-scale war in the region. The mission must be executed with discretion to preserve plausible deniability and avoid triggering open conflict with local factions.

Synixe will deploy from the UNMITAK FOB in Mantiq and has been granted safe passage by both the Six-Six and Watani factions to reach the police station northwest of Zari. While violating the Corridor Agreement may provoke hostilities from the Watani, such action may be necessary to complete the mission. The employer leaves that decision to the discretion of the Operations Lead.

Due to the likely presence of hostile drones, Synixe has acquired proprietary anti-drone equipment— the Fieldsure PLSE system. User manuals can be found at the FOB.
