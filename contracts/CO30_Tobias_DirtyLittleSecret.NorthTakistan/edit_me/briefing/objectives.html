<font color='#E3D310'>RESTRICTIONS</font>
The Corridor Agreement is a limited-access arrangement brokered by the CIA between Synixe and the Watani faction, permitting 
Synixe to operate within a defined zone of North Takistan. Under the terms, Synixe is authorized to move from the 
UN base in Mantiq to the police station northwest of Zari for the debriefing of a high-value detainee. The permitted area includes 
the corridor south of Mantiq, extending through and including Zari, and the Rasman valley south of Tarchi and Qorghan. All other 
areas—particularly south of Zari and east of Rasman—remain restricted. Watani forces have not guaranteed safe passage outside 
the approved zone, and any Synixe personnel spotted beyond it may be met with aggression. Strict adherence to the corridor
boundaries and low-profile movement are essential to avoid escalation.
