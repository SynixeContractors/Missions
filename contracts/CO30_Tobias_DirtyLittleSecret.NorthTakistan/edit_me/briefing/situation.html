North Takistan remains deeply fractured following the fall of General Farouk Al-Mansur’s regime and the June 6 Revolution that sparked nationwide unrest. 
The nationalist Watani faction now controls much of the southern territory, enforcing strict rule through military discipline and aggressive patrols. In 
contrast, the revolutionary Six-Six brigade holds only a handful of urban centers in the northwest, relying on local support and foreign aid to maintain 
their foothold. The extremist Ikhwan as-Sayf operates in scattered cells across the region, launching attacks to destabilize all sides. The UN maintains 
a fragile peacekeeping presence, but its influence is limited.

Name: Ikhwan as-Sayf ("Brothers of the Sword")
Location: Throughout the AO

The "Brothers of the Sword," are a ruthless Islamist militant faction operating in fragmented cells across the region. Driven by a vision of establishing
a khaliphate, they reject all as enemies of their cause. Their fighters are typically seen wearing black headgear and concealing their faces. Their equipment 
is largely scavenged from the remnants of fallen government armories, including AK-pattern rifles, RPGs, mortars, drones and heavy machine guns mounted 
on technicals. Despite their lack of formal supply chains, they are well-armed and tactically aggressive, often deploying VBIEDs and ambush tactics 
to destabilize both military and civilian targets. Their presence in the AO represents a volatile wildcard—unpredictable, uncompromising, and hostile 
to all.

guns mounted on technicals.They wear turqoise armbands with a golden lion on it. The Watani have entered uneasy ceasefires and backchannel deals when

dissent, making them a formidable force with unpredictable allegiances.
