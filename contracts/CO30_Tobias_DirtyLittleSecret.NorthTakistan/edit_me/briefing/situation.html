North Takistan remains deeply fractured following the June 6 Revolution that sparked nationwide unrest. The nationalist Watani faction now controls much of the south.
The revolutionary Six-Six brigade holds only a handful of urban centers in the northwest. The extremist Ikhwan as-Sayf operates in scattered cells across the region, 
attempting to destabilize all sides. The UN maintains a fragile peacekeeping presence, but its influence is limited.
