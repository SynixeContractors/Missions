North Takistan remains deeply fractured following the fall of General Farouk Al-Mansur’s regime and the June 6 Revolution that sparked nationwide unrest. 
The nationalist Watani faction now controls much of the southern territory. In contrast, the revolutionary Six-Six brigade holds only a handful of urban 
centers in the northwest, relying on local support and foreign aid to maintain their foothold. The extremist Ikhwan as-Sayf operates in scattered cells 
across the region, launching attacks to destabilize all sides. The UN maintains a fragile peacekeeping presence, but its influence is limited.
