The democratic regime of Ruha is collapsing. After a series of scandals, the ruling party, the United Democratic Front (UDF), has lost public support. An election was called, and the UDF appears to have won by a narrow margin, but this is disputed by the opposition parties, and the Unit Nations has called for an independent investigation to be allowed to take place. The UDF has refused, and the opposition parties have called for a general strike and protests.

Last night, Raven Security operators arrived in Ruha, and have began to take control of government buildings, airports, and other key infrastructure. It is expected the Prime Minister will take authoritarian measures to suppress the protests.

Early this morning, a Raven Security team raided the homes of two opposition leaders, Pawe≈Ç Kozlowski and Jan Lewandowski, where they are believed to still be held.

A wealthy businessman, Tymon Stolarski, who has been living outside of Ruha for the past few years, wants to see these opposition leaders freed and has hired Synixe Contractors to do so.

Vehicles and aircraft has been arranged by Mr. Stolarski, and we have been smuggled into the region using his business connections.
