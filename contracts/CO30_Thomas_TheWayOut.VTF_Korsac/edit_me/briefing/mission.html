Contractors have been hired to raid an old KDF communications post, now taken over by separtist forces.

The main goal is to destroy enemy supplies, but also to raid the main structure for any intel.

Contractors are warned to not stray too far west, as that is where the majority of separtist armor support is positioned.

Friendly forces are present in the AO, and enemies regularly utilize AT mines on roads, and AP mines on undefended flanks.
