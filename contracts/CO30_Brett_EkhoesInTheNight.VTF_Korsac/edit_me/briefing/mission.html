Comms Ekho, a small decommisioned signals intelligence base has recently begun emitting signals around 0100.

The Korsac Police have been unable to determine who or why people have been entering the facility, but they suspect it is tied to separatist terrorist groups that have been active in recent months.

The Korsac Police is not equipped or trained for such operations, especially at night. They have hired us to secure the site and destory any old military assets that may be useful to the extremist groups.
