            <br/>They will likely be equipped with no more than surplus weaponry, light anti-tank launchers, and technicals. It is known that they may disguise as civilians in order to carry out attacks.

            <br/>Contractors have been hired to arrest Hasan Okoye, an important figure of the Kujari region - ID by blue suit. He is expected to be arriving at Marwey airfield by 1715.
            <br/>
            <br/>We are tasked with arresting Okoye, and ensuring he arrives safely at the main villa of Kyari Kinnai. Once there, he is to be left restrained alongside the two businessmen in suits at the main building, within the second floor.
            <br/>
            <br/>Contractors are not allowed outside of the Area of Operations. Additionally, it has been highly recommended to avoid travelling through the Red Zone, as it is deemed heavily hostile with major enemy presence.
            <br/>
            <br/>Contractors will maintain security at Kyari Kinnai's villa and fend off any possible attacks until contract expiration time.
            <br/>
            <br/>No one except for Gendarmerie personnel is allowed entrance to the premises of the villa. Contractors are to prevent anyone to enter uninvited by any means necessary.
            <br/>
            <br/>Contractors will primarily ensure the villa is safe, and will keep Okoye alive. Secondarily, they shall attempt to keep the two other businessmen alive aswell.
            <br/>
            <br/>Once contract is completed, Okoye shall be brought back to Synixe's FOB.
