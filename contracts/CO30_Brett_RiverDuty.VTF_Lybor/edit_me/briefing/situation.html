The region around the city of Kinney has seen a recent increase in industrial activity.
The area has had a healthy logging industry for many years, but recently a larger
gas and oil industry has begun to take hold. Some of the local residents have
expressed concern about the environmental impact of the new industry, but the
city insists that the new industry will bring jobs and prosperity to the area.

A group of extreme environmentalists, have taken up against the new industry.

The group has not been violent in the past, but they have been known to trespass,
vandalize, and harass executives of the new companies. The group has been
growing in size and has recently begun to make threats against the companies.

A local law expanding the rights of the companies to use public land for their
operations has been met with protests from the environmentalists. The upcoming
annual Mayson Festival is expected to draw a large number of visitors to the area,
and a threat has been made to disrupt the festival...
