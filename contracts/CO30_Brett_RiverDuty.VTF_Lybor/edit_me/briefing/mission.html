We have been contracted to prevent attacks on critical infrastructure that may occur
during the annual Mayson Festival.

The environmental protesters have not been known to be violent, and we believe that
the majority of the protesters will not be violent. However, we have received intelligence
that a small group is planning to cause damage to industrial sites, bridges in the
area, and most dangerously, the dam.

The city officials have decided to continue with the festival, and want to avoid
further upsetting their citizens. They have asked us to keep a low profile, and
to avoid using lethal force unless absolutely necessary.
