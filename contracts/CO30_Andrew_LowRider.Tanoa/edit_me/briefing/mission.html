A wealthy man has reached out. Local bandits have confiscated his prized, custom painted, pickup truck. He is requesting that we bring it back. If possible, he is also requesting to eliminate those who took his pickup.
Tui Naivalu works in the town of Lami. He was apprehended and assaulted as he got out of his vehicle to walk into work at 0800. He saw the criminals drive to the east with his prized possession. He is managing to get a ride home, in the La Rochelle area. He didn't give many more details other than that.
We are asked to retrieve the vehicle and deliver it to his home in the north.
