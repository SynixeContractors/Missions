At 0100 a helicopter that was transporting CTRG operatives, who were escorting a data terminal, was shot down. Contractors must move to the crash area and find the location of the operatives and the terminal.

Once this is done contractors must destroy the data terminal to prevent the enemy from accessing its contents and rescue the people involved in the crash. Should some of the people involved already be dead contractors must extract the bodies for repatriation.
