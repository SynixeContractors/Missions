With full military authorization Dutch military is currently preparing a naval invasion onto the Islands. The key pre-invasion operation is neutralizing the surface-to-air missile batteries on both Islands.

Dutch submarines Orka and Dolfijn have successfully sunk a North Korean frigate and a resupply ship carrying tanks and APCs. The garrison on Islands has been cut off and the limited resources have been committed to the south in anticipation of upcoming naval invasion, leaving mostly infantry in the northern parts.

Synixe has been contracted with neutralization of SAM battery in the northern part of West Lingshan which shot down one of the Dutch reconnaissance drone off the coast of Selamat island. North Korean SAM batteries usually consist of 2 Air Surveillance And Target Acquisition Radar and 5-6 launchers usually spread quite wide and connected with datalink. It is crucial that we cripple the radars and eliminate most launchers in the AO. Via electronic surveillance we've been able to identify the radar sites, the western site seems to be emitting more radiation than usual. Additionally, Synixe will be inserting on boats and may have to requisition transport on the island.
