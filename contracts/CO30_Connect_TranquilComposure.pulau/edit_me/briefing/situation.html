The Lingshan Islands are located in the South china Sea 400 km off the eastern coast of Philippines. Ever since the colonial days the islands have been under the control of the Dutch, with only a short period during Second Sino-Japanese War where they were under Japanese occupation. They have since become a common holiday destination for Chinese tourists.

After successful action in recovery of key research mission, Synixe is once again called to help in Lingshan Islands.
