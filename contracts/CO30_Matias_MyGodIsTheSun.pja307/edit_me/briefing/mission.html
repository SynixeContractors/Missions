A civil war has been running in the region, fueled by a desire to control the local production of crude oil. Three months in the scales are about to tip, apparently the opposing side has obtained a set of Zamak MRLs which they intend to use to attack several friendly controlled sites throughout the region.

Our friendlies are unable to muster up the manpower to hunt down and destroy these trucks and have hired Synixe to do it. The objective is to move into the AO and find and destroy those trucks.

HUMINT has provided us with photos of what the targets look like and has revealed the approximate locations of the three trucks, the locations are as follows.

- In the valleys west of Oum Ali.
- In the area near Ben Guerrir.
- In the area near Tildjen.
