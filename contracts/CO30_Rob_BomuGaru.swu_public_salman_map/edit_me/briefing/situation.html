Name: ISIS
Location: Al Salman

Born again from the crucible of fire that is the ongoing hostilities in the Levant, ISIS has achieved several key victories over the Iraqi government, including at Al Salman. However, their hold over the city has been short lived, as their two initial victories quickly turned to hasty retreats. They are hoping this third capture of the city will be all that is needed. ISIS forces in the AO have been seen equipped with last generation small arms, shoulder mounted weapons, and the occasional light wheeled asset.
