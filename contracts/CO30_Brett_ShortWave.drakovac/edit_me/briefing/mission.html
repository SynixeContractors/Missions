A well trained militia has taken the island of Kovaceva and is holding 8 hostages.

We have been hired to extract the hostages and eliminate the militia threat.

They have issued a statement that they will execute the hostages if any attempt is made to rescue them. It is crucial that we hit the site where the hostages are being held first and with extreme action.
