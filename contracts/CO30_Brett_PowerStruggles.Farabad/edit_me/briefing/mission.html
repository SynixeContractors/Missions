Synixe Contractors has been hired to push back Sawt al-Ajadad forces that have secured towns to the north east of the capitol.

A JSI outpost was present in the area, but was abandoned after the region saw no activity for months, and other regions required additional support.

This has unfortunately allowed Sawt al-Ajadad to quickly and quietly push further south, and now they are within striking distance of the capitol.

We're being brough in as additional support to secure the region and push back Sawt al-Ajadad. It is not known with certainty if they are in the region, but we are also to secure Yasin al-Qassab, the leader of Sawt al-Ajadad if we find him.
