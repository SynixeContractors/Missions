The Gendarmerie received a message from a local man known to police, Kahakuhale Kingi. He has previously been arrested multiple times for disrupting public order, refusing lawful orders, uttering threats, and other minor offenses.

The message stated:

> Today is the day of reckoning. Send your most useful idiots, the ones who are willing to die for a cause they don't understand.
> The natural consequences of your actions must be accelerated, you won't get to die peacefully in your beds.
> You won't get to know peace while sowing the seeds of pain and suffering.
> You know where I am, I am waiting, come receive your gifts.

The Gendarmerie says Kingi became very vocal against the government and the police after an industrial site was approved to be built next to his land 23 years ago. At that time he started a protest movement that gained public support, and was jailed multiple times, but often without official charges.

The Gendarmerie has been monitoring Kingi for the last 23 years, but he has never displayed any suspicious or violent behavior, and has kept to himself since the protest movement against industrialization of the islands ended many years ago.

Due to the nature of the message however, the Gendarmerie is taking it very seriously. They have requested our assistance, as they are concerned that Kingi may be planning to attack the industrial site with explosive devices, which they have no experience in dealing with.

Dock records show that Kingi has recently imported several large packages, but the manifests are missing from the dock records. We are advised to proceed with extreme caution.
