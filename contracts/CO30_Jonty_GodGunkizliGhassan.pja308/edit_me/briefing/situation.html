The North African Army is facing disruptions in Gunkizli. Two airfields are nearly inoperative due to attacks by Jaysh al-Ustadha. Led by Ghassan al-Layl, the group has halted operations and supplies between the airfields.

Ghassan al-Layl, leader of Jaysh al-Ustadha, aims to overthrow foreign influence and establish a militant-controlled state. Intelligence suggests his motives are rooted in reclaiming autonomy and eradicating opposition.
