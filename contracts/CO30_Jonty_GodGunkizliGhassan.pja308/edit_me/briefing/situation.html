The North African Army is facing significant disruptions in the region of Gunkizli. Two vital airfields have been rendered nearly inoperative due to the relentless attacks on their convoys by a militant group known as Jaysh al-Ustadha (Army of the Righteous). The militant group, led by the elusive and ruthless Ghassan al-Layl, also known as the "Night Lion", has effectively halted operations and supplies between the two airfields.

Ghassan al-Layl, the leader of Jaysh al-Ustadha, is driven by a fierce desire to overthrow any foreign influence in the region and establish a self-sustained, militant-controlled state. His strategic ambushes and guerrilla warfare tactics have made him a formidable adversary. Intelligence reports suggest that his motives are deeply rooted in reclaiming what he believes to be the rightful autonomy of his people and eradicating any opposition to his vision.
