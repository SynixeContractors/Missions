We've been reached out to a civilian who is on the run from bandits. He and his family are, in his words, being wrongly targeted by a rebel bandit group who have single out his town. This man has successfully removed his family from the equation by getting them out. Bandits caught up with him and now he is on the run from them. 

Our VIP target left the town of Aydintepe, and said he had a place with friends to the west. Before he could say more, we lost communication with him. We are to investigate the area to the west of Aydintepe and find out man. He stated he is wearing a traditional blue garb, white pants, and a blue turban. He stated he was ditching his jeep nearby. If you see it, you might be getting close.
