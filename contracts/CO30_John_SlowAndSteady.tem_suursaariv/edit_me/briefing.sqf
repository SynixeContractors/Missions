            <br/>A work-site (Mattila) and a main exportation harbor (Lounatrivi) have been found to be mined with military grade Anti-Personnel mines as well as some Improvised-Explosive-Devices. These are to be disarmed and collected. Failing that, markers are to be placed for units that are capable of defusal.

            <br/>A ruined village (Miettil√§) has also been found to have UneXploded Ordnance (UXO). These UXOs are to be disarmed and collected. Failing that, they are to be marked for defusal by capable units later.
            <br/>
            <br/>When all explosives have been collected/marked, meet with New Suursaariv Govt. Militia (Factory Area) to drop off the explosives for disposal or inform them of the successful markings.

            <br/>Any and all terrorist activity are to be eliminated.
