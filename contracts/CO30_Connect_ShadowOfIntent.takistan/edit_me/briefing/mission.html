Sadiq Naeem has joined and currently leads IaS in the Manfalat region of Takisan. He and his closest lieutenants are known for wearing ballistic masks to hide their faces. Sadiq himself uses a mask adorned with anime-styled drawing.

IaS has recently seized a base in Garmsar after a heavy gunfight with enemies coming over the hills. Additionally, the base in Feruz Abad has gone silent. In this area, Sadiq's clique is sure to be implicated. Synixe has been contracted to investigate those two threads and produce a body.
