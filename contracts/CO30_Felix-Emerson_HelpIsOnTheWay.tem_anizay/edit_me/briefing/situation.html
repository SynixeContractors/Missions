A regional crisis has been cooking up in the region of Anizay, and as a result, a civil war ensued. NATO had been assisting its allies and associates in evacuations in the weeks leading up to the major pullout, now all that is left is some remnants of a few UNA forces still stationed at FOB Nauzad and FOB Obeh.

Name: Anizay Freedom Insurgency

The Anizay Freedum Insurgency has been trying to gain leverage over both national and international sources for attempting to counter many new foreign relations and reforms in Anizay, as such, they have taken to violence as a means to promote their message and pursue a revolution.

As such, they have started to go after some notorious VIPs in the region of Anizay who have been left behind during the NATO pullout, and subsequently, the start of UNA's recess in the region.

They are often seen wearing robes and turbans, and seem to be equipped with surplus equipment consisting of small arms and some statics.
