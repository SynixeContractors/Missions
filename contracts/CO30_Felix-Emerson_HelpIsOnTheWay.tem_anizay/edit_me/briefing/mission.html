Contractors have been hired to rescue VIPs in the region of Anizay after a cease in evacuation operations by both NATO and UNA.

As such, a meeting point has been established at FOB Nauzad's main barracks to find information provided by UNA on the VIPs to be rescued.

Contractors are to head to the meeting point, retrieve any and all relevant information on the VIPs, and get them to safety back at FOB Nauzad by any means necessary.
