The Takistani Government has called upon our help. They're having issues with the Taliban in recent memory. ION PMC is in the area and have it on good authority (and intel) that the Taliban are looking to target infastructure, mainly oilfields. ION PMC is spread thin protecting the areas, and are unable to check in with a squad who has gone radio silent. That's where Synixe comes in.

We are tasked with going to the Par-e Siah oilfield and to check on the squad. While ION PMC prays for just a miscommunication, we should be prepared to clear out any enemies that we come into contact with. If you wish, ION PMC has a mutual FOB at Lalezar and are willing to provide two (2) HMG off roads and a MSE-3 Marid (HMG). They have the supplies, just not the manpower.

If things have taken a turn for the worst, we are asked to recover those alive or dead and bring them to this FOB. Also, if possible, check the infastructure to make sure everything is in tip top shape.
