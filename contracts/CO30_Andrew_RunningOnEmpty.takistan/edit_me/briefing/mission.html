The city of Zargabad is requesting assistance. The center of the city has been occupied by Taliban forces. Civilians are fleeing for their lives, most making a run for the hills or airfield. The airfield is under the security of Theseus INC. As they hold the airfield, we are tasked with clearing the Taliban insurgents from the civilian homes. 

The Taliban drove into the city, some with mounted guns on the back. They have been seen with RPGs and carrying mounted & static firearms. Be wary walking down the city streets.
