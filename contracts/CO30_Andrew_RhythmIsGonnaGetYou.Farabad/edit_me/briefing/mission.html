President Ali is going forward with a grand festival in the Parade Grounds and Independence Park just outside his Presidential Palace. The local enforcement force are vastly understaffed, with most of the funding going to the military. With the military preoccupied in other areas, we are asked to assist with security for the event.

There are a total of four entrances, all marked on your maps with blue flag markers. All Blufor marked areas are friendly occupied by local enforcement or military personnel. The blue exclamation marks are road closures and should not be expecting any road traffic. They are also occupied by friendlies.
We are not permitted to enter the Presidential Palace or Embassy Compound UNLESS we have a clear, identifiable threat in that area. We are not permitted to shoot in unless our shot will only hit the designated threat. Failure to do so will be seen as an act of violence against our employer. Tread carefully.
