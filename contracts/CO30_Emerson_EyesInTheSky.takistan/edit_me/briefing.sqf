            <br/>Takistani Local Militia
            <br/>Takistan has many tribal militias that do not support either the Takistan army nor western forces. They will defend themselves if they feel threatened.

            <br/>There are many civilians going about their day within the greater Takistan region. However, there should be limited amounts of civilians in the town of Nur due to it being taken over by the Takistani army.
            <br/>

            <br/>After the assassination of a high ranking Takistani general in January of 2030, US-Takistani relations began to severly degrade. In the following months, resentment grew among Takistan against the United States and other 'terrorist' nations allied with them.
            <br/>
            <br/>Looking to gain intel on the brewing Takistani army, the US decided to deploy one of its new stealth drones in the region.
            <br/>
            <br/>At some point along the drone's flight path, it suffered an unknown malfunction and contact was lost. It is highly unlikely that Takistani forces brought it down, due to their outdated equipment. Based on the flight path and last known position, the US believes the drone crashed somewhere near the Takistani border village of Nur.
            <br/>
            <br/>Since the United States is to have no official presence in Takistan, we have been contracted to secure the crash site. Since it will be impossible to recover the drone in a timely manner, we have been ordered to destroy it. Secondarily, we are to recover any sensitive data the Takistani Army may have extracted (hard drives/thumb drives/laptops).
            <br/>
            <br/>Based on what recon the drone gathered before it was lost, the Takistan Army had a concentration of forces near the town of Rasman and the nearby airfield.
