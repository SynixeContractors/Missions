Recently CSAT has made a push into the island of Malden, attempting to seize control of it. Since they currently lack manpower to fully control the island they've settled with controling the outer portions.

NATO has hired Synixe to assist them in pushing back CSAT, while they fight on the eastern side of the island Synixe will have to clear positons on the western side.
