<br/>Sequence: A4-11
<br/>
<br/>During the initial recon phase of this mission, we didn't think James exhibited the same characteristics as his brother. After the disapointing loss of Daniel, we still were no closer to the results we desired.
<br/>
<br/>James's cells have responded tremendously to the surges, perhaps we will be able to isolate what allows his cells to storage such incredible amounts of energy.
<br/>
<br/>His lack of cooperation is a concern, but we will continue to monitor his progress.
