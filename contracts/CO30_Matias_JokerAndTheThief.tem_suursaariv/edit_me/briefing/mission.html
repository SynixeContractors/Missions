Recently a trawler carrying a set of weapon shipments belonging to Laredo Weapons Manufacturing LLC was attacked of the coast of SÃ¤kkiluoto.

The attackers made of with several boxes of weaponry, but luckily for our employer they didn't notice the trackers that were placed in the boxes.

Synixe has been hired to recover all of the boxes that were being carried in the trawler. We have been provided with diving gear as well as underwater rifles because it is believed that some boxes may have fallen overboard during the attack.

Be aware that the local militia does not possess the capabilities to attack a moving boat, so whoever attacked it is gonna be better equipped.
