An undercover CIA asset in Takistan has recently gathered crucial intel on the Taliban.

The CIA has hired Synixe to retrieve the intel from their asset. After being smuggled across the border contractors are tasked with contacting Abdul-Qadir Masood and receiving the intel package.

Contractors are to avoid the Takistan border at all costs. The border is well gaurded and patrolled by the Takistan military.

Taliban forces are present throughtout the region and may be well armed due to being on home turf.

Masood was traveling from his home in Feruz Abad to a CIA safehouse in Kakaru, Masood will be driving his flatbed work truck and should be waiting at the safehouse.
