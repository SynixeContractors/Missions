Twenty four hours ago the FIA orchestrated a surprise attack and took over military and industrial sites all over north eastern Altis. They did this with the intention of getting the current government to dissolve so that they can step in and take power.

FIA has demanded the government to dissolve and has publicized that they have installed explosives on the sites they took. Starting 15:30 they are gonna start blowing them up one by one every 30 minutes until they get what they want. They say they will start with the Radar Base, followed by the Power Plant, then the Military Facility and finally the Solar Plant.

Needless to say the government does not intend to step down, but at the same time they cannot let this happen since it would severely cripple Altis's industrial and military capabilities. Therefore they have hired Synixe to sort out the situation before it's too late.
