Victorious in taking the capital Georgetown, the NRT is now looking to consolidate and fully secure it's holdings over the island. Many members, though not all, of the Tanoan Army, Navy, and Airforce defected, giving the NRT control over a small number of Helicopters and tracked vehicles. They are equipped with early 21st century weaponry, and some body armour.

While most of the Tanoan armed forces defected en-masse, the Gendarmerie and a small contingent of the army stayed loyal. The remaining Gendarmerie forces were responsible for getting many of the HVT's to safety after the Federal government collapsed. Aiding them are a number of army loyalists.
