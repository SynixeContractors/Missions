Name: Nouvelle République de Tanoa (NRT) 
Location: Most of the nation

Victorious in taking the capital Georgetown, the NRT is now looking to consolidate and fully secure it's holdings over the entirety of the state. Many members, though not all, of the Tanoan Army, Navy, and Airforce defected to the NRT after the Federal government collapsed, giving the NRT control over a handful of Helicopters and APC's. Their equipment consists mainly of French small arms and light and heavy weaponry.

Location: Safe houses

While most of the Tanoan armed forces defected en-masse, the Gendarmerie mostly stayed loyal. The remaining Gendarmerie forces were responsible for getting many of the HVT's to safety after the Fenderal government collapsed. Aiding them are a number of army loyalists.
