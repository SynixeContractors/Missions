Following the end of the 2024 Finnish Civil War, the UN, in accordance with the Mersch accords, stationed a United Assistance (UNA) force in South Ostrobothnia to keep the peace and to act as a buffer.

UNA forces have taken up defensive positions spanning from Rautakorpi to south of Jussila. So far, Russian forces have not engaged UNA units. 

The UN has no faith that Russian forces will cease their advances in the region. However, the UN feels by engaging the Russians directly they risk expanding the conflict past it's current borders. Therefore, UN has employed Synixie to aid in curtailing Russian advances.

Name: Armed Forces of Russia
Location: Believed to be south of the Tuonela line

The Armed Forces of Russia have deployed elements of the 9th Seperate Guards Artillery Brigade, and 5th Anti-aircraft Missile Brigade. It is believed that both units forces and quipment have yet to fully reach the AO. 

It is believed that the force in the AO is currently below it's operating standard due to logistical delays. We approximate that alongside a sizeable infantry and motorized elements, they are fielding 1 artillery battery, a ground-to-air radar emplacement, multiple vehicle air-defence assets, and a small, lightly armoured QRF.

Name: United Assistance Forces
Location: Heikkola, and stationed along the Tuonela line

An array of checkpoints have been created along the established line that seperates the UNA from their Russian counterparts. While they will not move into Russian held territory, they have standing orders to defend against any Russian or JK incursions

Name: South Ostrobothnia civilians
Location: Entire AO

Large amounts of South Ostrobothnia refugee's have started flowing over the border and into UN and Finnish held territory. South Ostrobothnia stayed largely loyal to the central government during the civil war which gives reason for the exodus.
