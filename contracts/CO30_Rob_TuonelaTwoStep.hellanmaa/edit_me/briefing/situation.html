Finnish Civil War 2022-2024

Starting in 2017, a wave of aggressive ultra-nationalism began sweeping across Finland. While largely organic in nature, the groups leading the movement benefited from financial, political, and military support from the Russian Federation.

In 2020, Elias Koskinen, a moderate politician with a background in academia and the diplomatic corp, was elected by the central coalition government to repair the political fractures within the country.

After multiple economic and political failures by the central government, and a sharp increase in foriegn interference, the ultra-nationalist groups took action and began overtly taking over local and regional governments by force.

By 2022, all attempts by the central government to stymy the actions of the hardliners had failed. After portions of the military defected, the People's Republic of Jyväskylä (JK) was declared.

Immediately, the Russian Federation recognized the JK as a soverign state. In response, the EU and NATO began shoring up it's support for the central government. 

Hostilities commenced early in the year. With most of it's support being in the interior of the country, the JK was able to quickly secure the vast majority of it. The central government retained control over the whole of the coast except for Oulu and the region of Kymenlaakso.

While the EU and NATO were half-invested in the conflict due to internal matters and geopolitical issues elswhere, the Russian Federation was able to amply supply JK forces with weapons, munitions, and manpower in the form of volunteers and PMC groups. 

The civil war ended in a statemate between the two sides. South Ostrobothnia became the most contested region in the conflict.

By 2024 both sides were unable to press into each others territory any further and a ceasefire was reached. Shortly afterwards, the Mersch accords were signed by both sides, albeit reluctantly by the JK.

The accords made the region of South Ostrobothnia a buffer state. It was agreed that neither sides forces would occupy it. To ensure compliance with the accords, it was agreed upon that the UN would station a peacekeeping force in the region. Again, the JK was reluctant to agree but did not have the power to press their ambitions.

In September 2024, Russian Federation forces were observed entering into and then occupying the south and South east portions of South Ostrobothnia. Russia declared Finnish government forces had violated the accords multiple times, and that UNA forces had remained silent while they did so.

Presently, Russia has moved artillery and anti-aircraft assets into the regions they have and are occupying. Citizens from the region have started crossing the western and northern border into Finnish government held territory. 

UNA forces have responded by setting up checkpoints on what has become the defacto border, but known within the local forces as the 'Tuonela' line

Following the end of the 2024 Finnish Civil War, the UN, in accordance with the Mersch accords, stationed a United Assistance (UNA) force in South Ostrobothnia to keep the peace and to act as a buffer.

UNA forces have taken up defensive positions spanning from Rautakorpi to south of Jussila. So far, Russian forces have not engaged UNA units. 

The UN has no faith that Russian forces will cease their advances in the region. However, the UN feels by engaging the Russians directly they risk expanding the conflict past it's current borders. Therefore, UN has employed Synixie to aid in curtailing Russian advances.

Name: Armed Forces of Russia
Location: Believed to be south of the Tuonela line

The Armed Forces of Russia have deployed elements of the 9th Seperate Guards Artillery Brigade, and 5th Anti-aircraft Missile Brigade. It is believed that both units forces and quipment have yet to fully reach the AO. 

It is believed that the force in the AO is currently below it's operating standard due to logistical delays. We approximate that alongside a sizeable infantry and motorized elements, they are fielding 1 artillery battery, a ground-to-air radar emplacement, multiple vehicle air-defence assets, and a small, lightly armoured QRF.

Name: United Assistance Forces
Location: Heikkola, and stationed along the Tuonela line

An array of checkpoints have been created along the established line that seperates the UNA from their Russian counterparts. While they will not move into Russian held territory, they have standing orders to defend against any Russian or JK incursions

Large amounts of South Ostrobothnia refugee's have started flowing over the border and into UN and Finnish held territory. South Ostrobothnia stayed largely loyal to the central government during the civil war which gives reason for the exodus.
