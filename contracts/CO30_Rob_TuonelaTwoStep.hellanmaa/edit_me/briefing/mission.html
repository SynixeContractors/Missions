Synixe has been contracted by the UN to neutralize anti-air and artillery assets in the AO. 

Constrained by logistical issues, Russian forces do not yet have their full compliment of equipment and manpower. Synixe will be taking advantage of this.

This isn't to say that the enemy does not have access to a relatively large manpower pool. They have also have a limited amount of lightly armoured vehicle assets. 

It should be noted that while understrength, the enemy likely is capable of utilizing what assets it has stationed in the AO to it's full capability. They have also dug-in well in the positions they have taken up. 

Be mindful of civilians in the AO and that there is a mass exodus of non-combatants towards UN borders.
