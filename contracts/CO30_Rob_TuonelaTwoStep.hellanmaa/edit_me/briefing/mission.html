Synixe has been contracted by the UN to neutralize anti-air and artillery assets in the AO. 

Constrained by logistical issues, Russian forces do not yet have their full compliment of equipment and manpower. Synixe will be taking advantage of this.

Light, and possibly medium, assets are to be expected. The enemy has also likely entrenched themselves quite well in the areas they control.  

Be mindful of civilians in the AO as there is a mass exodus towards UN borders.
