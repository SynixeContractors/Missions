NATO have hired us to remove a problematic Russian General, who has turned rogue in the Chernarus Region. 

NATO cannot set foot on Russian soil so have hired us to bring this General to heel. 

Congratulations on estabishling the beachhead.

The General has now made a statement that the WEST will now pay and is planning to launch cruise missles at 12:00pm today against several civilian targets in NATO territory. 
We have identified a communcation tower that you can use to upload a virus that will abort the launch. The virus will take 5 minutes to upload. Get to that communcation tower as quiuckly as possible the clock is ticking...
Also we have intel on where they are storing the rest of their curise missiles, destory these and remove the threat to NATO cities.

The General is now aware of your presence in Chernarus, so expect heavy resistance.
