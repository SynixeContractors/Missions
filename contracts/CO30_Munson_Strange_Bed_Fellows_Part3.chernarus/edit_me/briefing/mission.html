NATO have hired us to remove a problematic Russian General, who has turned rogue in the Chernarus Region. 

Full NATO forces cannot set foot on Russian soil, so they've hired us to bring this General to heel. 

A NATO General was on the way by BlackHawk to inspect our progress, but a MAYDAY call was received 20 minutes ago from his Helo. They reported a last bearing, but no other traffic has been received. 5 souls were on board; The General, 2 Pilots, an Officer and a Medic.
We have been tasked on finding the helicopter and retrieving the missing personnel, alive if possible. Start at the location of the MAYDAY call, be-careful something took down that bird.
