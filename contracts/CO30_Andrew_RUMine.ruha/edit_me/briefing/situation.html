The streets of Zargabad have been taken over by Taliban forces. They've infilitrated houses and killing anyone in their way. The situation seems dire.

Ruha Government
The Ruha Government is desperate for assistance. They're begging for any help as they have no one to assist their militia and law enforcement agency.

<font color='#d81717'>ENEMY FORCES</font>
Looters & Rioters
Location: Unknown.
Known to be anti-government civilians, they are defined as enemy. Armed and possibly dangerous, they will not give a second thought to kill anyone in their way for their gain. Dressed like a normal civilian, these anti-government individuals will be armed with basic firearms and use guerrilla tactics.


Unknown Cult faction
Location: Unknown.
A cult like organization has stepped up to the plate to fill the void in the power vacuum. They have been seen wearing tinfoils hats, and can range to being armed as much as a farmer to being geared to the nine. These individuals will die for their cause, believing it to be for the common good. Known to possible have access to armed technicals and might have commondere an apc or two from the local forces. Be weary.

Ruha Law Enforcement
Locations: Metsälä Airport, Ruha Police HQ, and patrolling throughout the region.
The local Law Enforcement has dwindled to be a shell of what it once was. With manpower down and the funding for supplies nonexistent, it is not the workhorse it needs to be in a crisis such as this. The few remaining officers are geared with police issued gear, and while not numerous, armed quite well.

Ruha Pro-Government Militia
Locations: Kivimäki, Länsikylä Sawmill, and patrolling throughout the region.
Civilians who support the government have banded together and formed a miltia to help assist the dwindled police force. Civilians have taken their local arms to help defend their homes and region from anti-governmental players. They look more like a militia force than their counterparts, but it is often difficult to discern them from anti-governmental looters and rioters. It is in our best interest to confirm hostility before engaging.

IDAP
Location: Kaaranmännikkö Stadium
IDAP is trying to provide well needed supplies to civilians in need. They've set up a camp in the stadium and are doing their best to provide those who are in need. It has been reported that there has been trouble in that area with Anti-Government members stirring trouble. Often they steal or rob supply trucks bringing supplies in. There is not enough Pro-Government forces to be there 24/7. Be mindful when approaching.

Civilians are present in the area and may or may not be in support of either Synixe Contractors, the Pro-Governmental or Anti-Governmental Side.
