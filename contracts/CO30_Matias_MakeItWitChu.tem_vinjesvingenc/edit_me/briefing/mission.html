A week ago John Mankiew an american reporter AAN who was covering the ongoing civil war in the region disappeared. Mankiew disappeared while "illegaly" documenting activities in the separatist controlled Northern region.

HUMINT has revealed that Mankiew is being held captive in F.O.B Abo, HQ for the separatist forces. AAN is paying Synixe to mobilize north and extract Mankiew back to friendly territory. A chopper will be waiting at the airfield in order to fly Mankiew home.

Since we are moving norht, loyalist forces have asked us to give them a hand by sabotaging as many assets in FOB Abo as possible. AAN has also provided us with a picture of Mankiew from his last news transmission, said picture will be available in a screen in your F.O.B.
