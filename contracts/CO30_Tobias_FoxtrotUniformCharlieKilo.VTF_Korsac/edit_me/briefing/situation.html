NATO's sphere of influence is ever growing in Eastern Europe, attracting Korsac as a prospective member.  To articulate their interest in joining NATO, Korsac Defense Force will be hosting joint exercises with NATO member states. The United States, United Kingdom, Germany and Livonia will take part in these exercises, training alongside Korsac Defense Forces.

However, not everyone in Korsac approves of this, as Pro-Russian insurrectionists strongly oppose closer ties with Europe and NATO.

The LDF have volunteered to provide supplies and material for the duration of the exercise and has prepared a convoy to be moved to the area of operations.
Synixe has been hired to provide protection and logistical support to the convoy.
