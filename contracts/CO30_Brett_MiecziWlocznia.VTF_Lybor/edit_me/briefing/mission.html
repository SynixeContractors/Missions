Livonia is fighting off an incursion of Russian backed forces, The Livonian Protectors, claiming to be liberating the oppressed peoples of many of the country's regions.

The LDF is making progress as they push back the invaders to the North East, but with the Russians supplying the insurgents with heavy vehicles, the progress has slowed. The LP have heavily defened the area around Kinney, holding the critical choke point of the river and its crossings.

The LDF has hired Synixe Contractors to use our expertise in anti-vehicle operations and strategic strikes to help them push the LP back and secure the river crossings.

The ground forces, callsign Włócznia (Spear), will be ready to push and secure the bridges as we eliminate the LP's heavy vehicles and make space for the LDF to advance.

We will be using HAT, MAT, and UAV, and the LDF's mobile artillery, Miecz (Sword), to destroy the LP's heavy vehicles and fortifications.
