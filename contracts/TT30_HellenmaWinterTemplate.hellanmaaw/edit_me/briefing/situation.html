<font color='#d81717'>ENEMY FORCES</font>
Name: Kardishev Front
Location: Unknown

Ultra-nationalist, anti-government group that has been present in the region since before the civil conflict. Have grown stronger due to the previous lack of centralized power in the government. Made up of deserters, ex-soldiers, and radical civilians alike, they are mainly hostile to contractors, due to Synixe working with authorization from the current government, however they can be neutral if contractors do not get in the way of their objectives.

<font color='#1d69f6'>FRIENDLY FORCES</font>
Name: UNA
Location: Hööpakka, Heikkola

Took over for Russian Forces in the region, but steadily being drawn down as the peace keeping mission comes to an end. Just there to provide protection and sanctuary to refugees, rarely intervening in fights unless UNA or IDAP are already involved. While mostly drawn away from the politics of the region, unless there is a Green on Blue incident, contractors are friendly and should have support (what little there is) from UNA forces.

<font color='#139120'>INDEPENDENT FORCES</font>
Name: Polk Baskera
Location: Nyman, Taipale, Rautakorpi

With the military being almost non-existant in the country due to treatises with Russia, a loop hole using unofficial government forces (under the control of the defacto political party) has allowed the government to project their power in the region. Generally will not care about contractor operations in the area however very corrupt, and have been known to have shady dealings with outside parties.

<font color='#993399'>IDAP</font>
Location: Hööpakka, Heikkola

In the region providing medical aid and food to civilians. Also heading mutliple demining operations in the area. Also known to show up to finished firefights to provide medical aid to whoever needs it, putting them at risk of retaliation from both Polk Baskera and the Kardishev Front.

<font color='#993399'>CIVILIAN CONSIDERATIONS</font>

Civilians are not allowed to own most small arms, except for hunting rifles and shotguns. However many civilians still possess massive amounts of weapons and explosives. Likewise, armed gatherings are illegal and will generally result in a visit from Polk Baskera. With the recent civil conflict, civilian loyalites are still mostly split and unknown.
