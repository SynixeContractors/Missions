Shapur, a once desolate desert, has become an industrial park. Villages have been bulldozed for commercial use. Village elders refuse to give up their lands to the wealthy business men and governmental officals. The local Shapur government has requested our assistance in dealing with the matter.

The government officials have tried paying the tribes to leave this area, but members refuse to go. They have threatened the locals through means of force but the elders laugh and believe them as idle threats. 

The government does not care how it gets done anymore. We have been asked to take care of their issue by either means. Force or peace, it is up to Synixe.
