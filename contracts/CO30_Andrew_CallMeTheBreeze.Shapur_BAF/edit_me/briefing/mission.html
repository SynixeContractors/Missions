Shapur, a once desolate desert, has been growing in recent times. Taliban forces have infilitrated and began recruiting new members while killing any of those who oppose. One village was abandoned and relocated on the hilltop in Shapur. 

For months, the village elders have cried to the Shapur government for assistance. Feeling disrespected by their lack of urgency, the village elders have been more vocal and adament over their issues. The government has given us this contract to assist and deal with the issues that are unknown at this point.

Synixe is assigned to do the bidding of the government in correcting whatever issue is present. We are to go to the elders and discuss their issues while also hopefully easing their minds.
