Intel from Adams:
Abu Ahmed was last spotted in Hazarbagh stockpiling supplies.
Mullah Rehmat was last spotted entering the mosque in Zargabad.
Multiple checkpoints setup around the main district.

Things to remember:
We are acting as civilians hired by the Taliban to transport weapons so keep your weapons concealed.
Take down Abu Ahmed first. If you get spotted while trying to approach Mullah, the taliban will definitely call for reinforcements from the north.
You'll be approaching Ahmed on the pretense of collecting weapons.
Ahmed knows who he has recruited. So if you come face to face with him be careful as you might get shot instantly.
After taking down Ahmed, approach the main district from the northern route coming from Hazarbagh. Taliban at the checkpoints will think that it's the weapons coming in.
