Intel from Adams:
Abu Ahmed was last spotted in Hazarbagh stockpiling supplies.
Mullah Rehmat was last spotted entering the mosque in Zargabad.
Multiple checkpoints setup around the main district.

Things to remember:
Try to disguise yourselves in Taliban outfits. It will be easier to get past the checkpoints and while approaching Ahmed's quarters.
Take down Abu Ahmed first. If you get spotted while trying to approach Mullah, the taliban will definitely call for reinforcements from the north.
You'll be approaching Ahmed on the pretense of collecting weapons.
Ahmed knows who he has recruited. So if you come face to face with him be careful as you might get shot instantly.
