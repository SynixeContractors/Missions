NATO forces in Zargabad are navigating a complex scenario. Despite recent clashes pushing back Taliban forces, Mullah Rahmat, the elusive regional leader, remains at large. Local sympathies favor the Taliban, impeding NATO's search efforts.

Embedded agent Alex Adams initially provided valuable intelligence on Taliban weapon caches and key figures like Abu Ahmed. However, upon returning to deliver crucial intel on potential targets, Adams went silent, raising concerns of possible capture.

The primary objectives include locating and apprehending Abu Ahmed and Mullah Rahmat, disrupting Taliban operations. Additionally, efforts to potentially rescue Adams and destroy Taliban weapon stockpiles are crucial. Tactics like approaching Zargabad's main district from the Northern Route aim to maintain the element of surprise and outmaneuver Taliban forces.
