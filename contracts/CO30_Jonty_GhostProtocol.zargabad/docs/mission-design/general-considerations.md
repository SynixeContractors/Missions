# General Considerations

## Making Dynamic Missions

### Empathy

When you want to make a mission that will engage players and allow them to creatively
solve problems, you should generally avoid thinking linearly. The first step in order
to do this is trying to get into the other faction's mind, and ask yourself:
"how would I do this?"

```admonish info
In general design, no matter the field, empathy is an important aspect of it.
Thinking about the players, or about the enemy faction, is a great way to ensure
a mission's design is consistent and realistic.
```

Imagine you set up a group of OPFOR to defend a location but this location has many
entrances, aside from the front door, there's gaps in the wall, there's a back
entrance, maybe there's a forest nearby. These are all things that a competent
enemy would think about when setting up an efficient defense for a position,
unless you purposely want to depict the enemy force as incompetent.

In this case, you can add a patrol outside and around the compound. Maybe a guy
or two guarding the gaps. This will account for different ways players could
possibly take on this objective, instead of just one.

Try to get in the enemy faction's mind and think to yourself how would you utilise
the resources you have to complete a task, whether it is an attack, an ambush, or
the defense of an important strategical keypoint.

```admonish info
It is nearly impossible to always know all of the ways players could possibly take
on an objective, let alone how a mission is going to play out. Accounting for this
kind of variability is a key sign to a thoughtfully made mission.
```

### Conditioning

An interesting thing we can keep in mind is the use of conditioning. Players are
often trying to put a puzzle together when playing missions based on the
cause-and-effect of their playthrough, and sometimes, if we can foresee this,
we can condition the way they will play, succeed, or fail, your mission.

If players are often finding IEDs in trash bags, that is going to turn into the
'implicit language' of the mission: trash bags have IEDs! If enemy garrisons
always have a campfire nearby, they are going to start associating that as a
mechanic within the mission: enempy encampments all have campfires! If all red
cars are smuggling weapons... you know how it goes! Players will go through a
'lessons learned' experience contained within your mission.

```admonish info
Classical conditioning is the act of learning through association. It is a cycle
of understanding a cause-and-effect.
```

This is generally a hit or miss, depending how explicit, how often and how long
your mission is, not to mention how attentive players are being, but this is a
subtle resource you can use to control your mission and guide players indirectly.

### Indexicality

Indexicality is the way we can communicate things indirectly to your players,
albeit this relies a lot more on intuition rather than conditioning. What this
means is that players won't have a "cause-and-effect" learning experience to
advice what could happen.

Resorting to this will rely heavily on the players' previous baggage and outside
experiences, let alone the experiences they've had previously with the game, while
not being entirely contained within your mission.

```admonish info
An index is a sign which is related to the object it represents, but not directly
or in a concrete way.
```

To put this simply, smoke cannot exist without fire, but it is not fire. The
presence of smoke lets us know, indirectly, that there is a fire nearby.

Following this same logic, if we have some knowledge of previous missions, real
life events, in-game universe lore, and even our users' backgrounds, it would be
possible to try and put together things we know they might expect.

If players are sent out on a mission to rescue a crashed down helicopter, smoke
is a good indicator of where there is fire, indicating where there is likely a
crash. If players are trying to find and locate enemies within a region, finding
their vehicles or some supply caches around might indicate that they either are,
or have been, nearby. A siren alarm after players raid a base or attack a location
is not an enemy attack in of itself, but it indicates that it is likely for
reinforcements to come and respond to the threat.

This entails taking on a lot of assumptions about your players, and the above are
very explicit examples. However, with proper thought, you can find your own ways
of communicating with the players entirely through your mission alone, which the
players may or may not catch.
