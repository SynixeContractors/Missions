# Pushing to GitHub

## GitHub Desktop

Once you are done your mission, you will need to push it to GitHub.

1. Make sure you are on the branch you intend to push, and all the files appear
in the "Changes" tab.
2. Enter a summary of the changes you made in the "Summary (required)" field.
3. Click "Commit to ...".
4. Click "Publish branch" or "Push origin" to push the changes to GitHub.
5. Click "Preview Pull Request" to open the pull request on GitHub.

## Github Website

You will need to create a Pull Request, so that the mission can be reviewed and
merged into the main mission repository.

Brodksy will do an automated review and check your mission for common mistakes.

Once Brodsky has reviewed and approved the mission, a mission reviewer will
review the mission and approve it or request changes.

Once the mission has been approved, it will be merged into the main mission
repository, and will be available for play on the server.

You can delete your branch once the mission has been merged.
