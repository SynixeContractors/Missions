# Setup GitHub

## Create a GitHub account

If you don't already have a GitHub account, you can create one for free at [github.com](https://github.com).

## Link your GitHub account to your Discord account

You will need to ask a Staff member to invite you to the Synixe Contractors GitHub organization.

You will receive an invite to the email address associated with your GitHub account,
or you can visit the [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/SynixeContractors).
Accept the invite to join the Synixe Contractors GitHub organization.

After you have accepted the invite, you will need to request access from a staff
member to the Mission Making team. This is separate from the `#mission-making`
channel in Discord.

## Install GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is a graphical user interface for GitHub. It allows you to easily
clone repositories, create branches, commit changes, and push changes to GitHub.

You can download GitHub Desktop for free at [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com).

## Clone the repository

Once you have GitHub Desktop installed and open, you can clone the repository by
clicking the "Clone a repository from the Internet..." button.
