Recently negotiation talks with Takistan regarding their impending nuclear weapons program have stalled and intelligence confirms that they're ready to break ground in the development of said weapons.

The country aims to transport its top scientist from a villa in Zargabad as well as a shipment of enriched uranium to an undisclosed location to begin working on nuclear weapons.

Instead of just blowing everyone and everything up the CIA and the DOD have hired Synixe to move into Zargabad and secure everything related to the program.

Contractors are to move into the villa where the scientists are and capture them along with any information related to the program. They are also to move into the airfield where the uranium is awaiting transport and secure it, intelligence suggests that it is being stored in metal containers.

Due to high sensitivity of the project troops have been stationed throughout the city, therefore contractors ar advised to avoid it as much as possible.
