            <br/>In 2017 in eastern Syria a group of six Wagner Group contractors beat and tortured to death a Syrian army deserter who was unarmed and dehydrated.
            <br/>They recorded the heinous act and uploaded it online, which eventually led to INTERPOL putting out a red notice on the six of them.
            <br/>The six soldier unit nicknamed the Valkyries had gone dark, until recently when they were spotted in the Chernarussian countryside training Chedaki soldiers.
            <br/>We have therefore been asked by INTERPOL to carry out the red notice, if possible apprehend the Valkyries but it is expected that they will not surrender
            so INTERPOL will also accept their dead bodies if the situation arises.
            <br/>
            <br/>The members of the Valkyries are as follow:
            <br/>
            <br/>-Semyon Gusakov, a pilot.
            <br/>
            <br/>-Yuri Naryshkin, a combat engineer.
            <br/>
            <br/>-Aleksei Yeltsin, a marksman
            <br/>
            <br/>-Oleg Pashinin, a tactical driver and tank commander
            <br/>
            <br/>-Roman Gorbunov, a team coordinator and FTL
            <br/>
            <br/>-Ilya Turchinsky, an EOD/Demolitions specialist
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>We have been provided with a UAV to scout out the field, as well as an ATV in case it is seen fit to send out a sharpshooter team.
