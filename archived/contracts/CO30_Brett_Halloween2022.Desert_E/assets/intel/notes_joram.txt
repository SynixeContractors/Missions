<br/>That nosey cunt is gone now, I can continue journalling now. I don't I'll be good at getting back into it, two months was a long break.

<br/>Sand gets everywhere, I hate it. Rumour is we're getting oranges tomorrow though, haven't had an orange in months. That'll be nice I guess.

<br/>This advisory is a joke, the dude's brother is in the middle of the Canadian wilderness. He's not going to show up an ocean away and attack us. We're wasting our time here.
<br/>Some ass reported seeing a flash of light in the sand, so they send the fucking plane to check it out.
<br/>Now Cory says we're extending patrols. pik.

<br/>Ik ben zo moe van deze verdomde patrouilles, er is niets in de verte hier, zinloos.

<br/>This aquisition mission tomorrow better go smoother than the last. We should've just brought in the brother in the first place, the doctor is too reckless these days.
<br/>Funding for this is tight, and containment is expensive, but what a stupid decision. Now we have to go out to grab him anyway.
<br/>At least we'll be able to reduce the patrols again, hopefully.

<br/>Maybe patrol duty isn't too bad, I heard the guys in containment are having a fun time with their new guest. They're not sure what exactly he does yet, they still think he'll be a suitable replacement for his brother.

<br/>My fucking day off and shit hits the fan. I just wanted to relax and they nearly blew the place up. Greg in containment says they now think he might be even more responsive than Daniel. They're going to get this whole place killed.

<br/>Everyone is super on edge today, I don't blame them. I heard even the lunatic in charge is worried. I don't know what to think anymore, I just want to go home.

<br/>Containment is way too quiet for things to be good, sounds like they're trying to keep him sedated. I don't know what they're doing, but I don't like it. This is way too dangerous for us to be handling. Just blow his head off and be done with it.

<br/>I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm not liking it. I heard they're going to try and get him to talk, but I don't know how that's going to go. I'm not sure if I want to know. I'm not sure if I want to know anything anymore.

<br/>That stupid doctor is going to get us all killed. Rumour is they are going to try another trial tomorrow, containment teams looked dead on their feet at lunch, I can't imagine the stress of having to be right next to that monster all day. Running the experiment while the guy is sedated is a terrible idea, I don't know why they're doing it.
