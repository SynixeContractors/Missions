The United States Department of State has moved its personnel out of Farabad, leaving the United States Marine Corps to secure US nationals and embassy property.

Synixe Contractors has been called in to assist in securing a group of Al-Jatar nationals that worked with the US embassy.

Abderrahim Haddani has been a key asset in the region of the US, providing valuable intelligence and local knowledge. He is currently unaccounted for.

With limited resources in the region, and US nationals still in danger, the United States Marine Corps has requested Synixe Contractors to assist in securing Haddani and his family.

Haddani lived in the city with his father and brother, both of whom are unaccounted for. The father and brother ran a small shop in the city.
While Haddani was provided a small apartment by the US embassy, he was known to spend most of his time at his family's residence or shop.
