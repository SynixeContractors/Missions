Around 1300 LocFor convoy was ambushed just down the road where contractors are staged inside the town of Maghdoot Khel.

Contractors have been tasked with securing an ambush site after LocFor QRF was unable to leave their base due to heavy resistance.

While unable to reach the ambushed squad over radio, gunfire and explosions were heard for multiple hours before ending abruptly around 1400.

A scout team from the base south of where contractors are staged reported that enemies have dug into the surrounding buildings, but were unable to gather further information before being engaged.
