For the last two weeks the Korsac airport has been locked down and closely guarded by a secretive private military company. Intelligence has revealed that they are flying in weapon shipments that are then distributed to the local guerilla groups that operate within the country.

The CIA along with the local government have hired Synixe to move into the airport and secure it in order to gather any intelligence pointing to where the shipments are being sent. If contractors were to find any intel they are tasked with tracking down the shipments and bringing them back to their F.O.B.

The CIA has been kind enough to provide Synixe with aerial pictures of the aiprot, they are available at the F.O.B in a slideshow.
