Recently IDAP has set up several humanitarian camps in cities and small towns. Their efforts have been successful and they've requested that Synixe delivers supplies to the camps.

We have been warned that a local militia has been threatening IDAPs operations and we must keep an eye out for them. Should they have taken over any of the IDAP sites we should attempt to clear the area so that IDAP can set up operations again.
