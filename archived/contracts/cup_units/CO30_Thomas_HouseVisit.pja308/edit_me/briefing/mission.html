With Kushan Soldiers pushing back Hezbollah-e-Kushan fighters to the southern region of the country during a recent military operation, it was rumored that months ago the fighters brought in an experienced bombmaker from Takistan. 3 months after this rumor surfaced, the number of successful explosive ambushes against Kushan Forces nearly tripled. With the massive uptick in IEDs being used against Kushan Forces, the fighting in region of Gunkizli (among many others in the country) has come to a standstill as Kushan Forces struggled to gain the momentum needed to continue their push. 

Recent information given to Kushan Army Command, sourced from British Intelligence, cited that the bombmaker (Khalil Yousuf) was present in the region in the town of Goztepe. This town is noted to be heavily defended by Hezbollah-e-Kushan fighters as it is important staging area for their attacks against Kushan Forces, but it is also staggerlingly close to BluFor's area of control. Kushan Forces took the opportunity to eliminate the bombmaker, but their attempts fell short due to their forces being ill-equipped to deal with explosives along the route, keeping them from being able to reach the town while taking major casualties in the process.

Hezbollah-e-Kushan fighters are well situated in the area, and won't let Yousef go easily. Ambushes even deep in their territory are expected, and reinforcements to any attack againt their fighters is likely.
