A change in politics causes a roar of potential bloodshed on Suursaari.

Mayor of Suursaari

The mayor of Suursaari has reached out to us with employment citing "Synixe is really in my budget and I'm hoping the things I heard are true in that they can keep me alive." The mayor has also employed Vanguard PMC and Theseus in different aspects of the assignment today, to test out a new potential security team.

The Cartel

The Cartel is the ruling class of the island, often showcasing force as their ruling power. The cartel is known to get what they want, when they want. With the newly elected mayor vowing to remove them from power and to disrupt their functions, the cartel has threatened to take matters into their own hands. 

They are relatively well funded, often shown showcasing their firepower of rifles, explosives, pickup trucks with armaments, and have expressed their "control of the skies". Be wary.

These members can be both seen as civilians as well as armed personnel. Stay viligant and always on guard. You never could tell who is friend or foe.

Civilians are present in the area and may or may not be in support of either Synixe Contractors, the PMC contractors, the Cartel, or even the mayor. Stand guard.
