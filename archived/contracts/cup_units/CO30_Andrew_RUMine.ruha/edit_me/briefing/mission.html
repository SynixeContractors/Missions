Ruha is the midst of a Civil War. The local law enforcement agency is a shell it once was. Inner government turmoil caused funding to be cut to the enforcement agency. With the lack of enforcement and governmental issues, a civil war has broken out.

Interestingly enough, there are Pro-Government and Anti-Government sides. On the Pro-Government side, we have the local police and a civilian militia who are helping to maintain order. On the anti-government side, you have looters, rioters, and some crazed lunatics, notably a cult like group who believe there is a large conspiracy at play. They have been gaining traction and followers. They've become increasingly dangerous, and are a real threat to the Pro-Government movement.

Amongst the ongoing issues, we have been hired by the Pro-Government side. Enforcement officials are spread through other assignments so we've been tasked with a delivery assignment.

We are to arrive at the Metsälä Airport and pick up all the supplies (marked in the southeast with a blue marker). If we are not able to transport the supplies as we do not have enough vehicles, a loaner police vehicle is available to be used. The police will pick up the vehicle from our base of operations at another time, so no need to bring it back. The supply route is as follows:

- Deliver (1) a weapons crate and (1) a white explosives crate to the friendly militia camp in Kivimäki (marked in the northeast with a green marker).
- Deliver (1) a basic medical crate, (1) an advanced medical crate, (1) a crate of food and water, and (1) a white uniform box to the IDAP base at the stadium in Kaaranmännikkö (marked in the northeast with a purple marker).
- Deliver (2) two ammunition crates to the militia base at Länsikylä Sawmill (marked in the north with a green marker).
- Deliver (1) a basic medical crate, (1) an advanced medical crate to the Law Enforcement Headquarters Building located in Ruha (marked in the center with a blue marker).

The government has declared a state of emergency for the region and civilians, though not barred from the streets, are not to be allowed to be carrying firearms. If civilians are seen with a firearm, then they are deemed hostile. Do bear in mind not to mistaken the local Pro-Government Militia for looters, rioters, or the cult.
