ArrowSec Contractors refuse to leave after the Rus' Government declared the AO an exlusion area due to "Biological Contamination" (The validity of those statements are unkown at this time).

Because brief fight between FAR soldiers and ArrowSec, the Rus' Goverment has been sued by ArrowSEC's client (Reedfin Medical Technology) claiming the attack, and the exclusion area as a whole, are illegal and unenforceable.

Looking to limit further issues, Synixe Contractors has been hired by the Rus' Government to raid the offices and airfield currently held by rogue ArrowSEC contractors, as an unknown 3rd party, and look for information specified by the Rus' Government.

The items brought back should be placed in the olive container back at the makeshift FOB.

The area itself is considered completely hostile. Contractors are expected to act independently, as everyone in the area will be hostile towards contractors, including FAR forces (except for the specified checkpoint, aware of Synixe's operation in the area) and likely any armed looters still left in the city.
