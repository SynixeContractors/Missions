We have been contracted to prevent attacks on critical infrastructure that may occur
during the annual Mayson Festival.

The region around the city of Kinney has seen a recent increase in industrial activity.
The area has had a healthy logging industry for many years, but recently a larger
gas and oil industry has begun to take hold. Some of the local residents have
expressed concern about the environmental impact of the new industry, but the
city insists that the new industry will bring jobs and prosperity to the area.

A group of environmentalists, have taken up against the new industry.

A local law expanding the rights of the companies to use public land for their
operations has been met with growing protests from the environmentalists.

The group has not been violent in the past, but they have been known to trespass,
vandalize, and harass executives of the new companies. The group has been
growing in size.

The environmental protesters have not been known to be violent, and we believe that
the majority of the protesters will not be violent. However, we have received intelligence
that a small group is planning to cause damage to industrial sites, bridges in the
area, and most dangerously, the dam.

The city officials have decided to continue with the festival, and want to avoid
further upsetting their citizens. They have asked us to keep a low profile, and
to avoid using lethal force unless absolutely necessary.
