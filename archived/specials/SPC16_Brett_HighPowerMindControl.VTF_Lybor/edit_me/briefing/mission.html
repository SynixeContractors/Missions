National Police have been dispatched to deal with a group of cultists that have moved into an abandonded radio station site. Reports in town are that the cultists have aquired explosives, planning to use them to defend their sites, and destroy radio towers in the area.

They claim they are moving to these rural areas to escape the high power mind control found in the cities, and they need to destroy the few towers in the area to prevent the mind control from following them.
