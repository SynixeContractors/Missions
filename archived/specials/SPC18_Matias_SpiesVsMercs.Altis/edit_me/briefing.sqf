    <br/>GAME RULES
    <br/>1- Spies must break into the facility, hack all three of the laptops and escape back to base.
    <br/>2- If you die you don't redeploy until the next game.
    <br/>3- Game ends either when the laptops are hacked and at least one spy calls for the extraction or when all the spies are killed.
    <br/>4- Mercs should have at least double the amount of spies
    <br/>
    <br/>The idea is that mercs will have heavy armor, frags, flares, chemlights and assault weapons while the spies have nvgs, no armor, flashbangs, smokes and silenced cqb weapons.
