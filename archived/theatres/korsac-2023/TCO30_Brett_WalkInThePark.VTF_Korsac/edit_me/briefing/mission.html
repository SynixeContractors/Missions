A family on the farmstead at 062046 was recently extracted from the area. They were providing information to the Government about the separatists movements, but a corrupt politician sold them out and 2 of the 3 sons were killed as contractors failed to extract them all in time.

The Armed Civilians, most of whom live on such farmsteads, have been thus far neutral in the conflict, only concerned with defending their homes and families.

The Government would like to curry favour with them, and has asked us to provide them with some supplies to help them defend themselves. Hopefully swaying them to provide more information to the Government again.
