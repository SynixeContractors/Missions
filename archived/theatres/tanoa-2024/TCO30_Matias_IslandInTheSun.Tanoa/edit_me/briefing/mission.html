Recently a confidential source came forward to media outlets that Ravi-ta Island is being used by the traffickers as a place where victims are taken so that clients can engage in whatever debauchery they desire.

Synixe has been hired to move into the island, gain control of it and rescue any victims that they may find.

The island consists of a main compound, a set of barracks for the guards and a supply depot with some small docks. It has been confirmed as well that island to the west of Ravi-ta is being used as hunting grounds where people are hunted for sport.

Should you find any evidence or POIs, they should be gathered and detained respectively.
