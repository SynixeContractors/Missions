We are tasked with checking several sites for the presence of workers that have not been registered with the authorities.

Any workers found are to be detained and taken back to our base for further processing. Government officials will pick up the workers from our base.
We are to detain the land owners if undocumented workers are found on their property. They will be collected by the HIL.

We are to be aware that the workers may be under duress and not want to cooperate, we need to ensure we operate efficiently and are able to gain their cooperation.

The traffickers will likely not be present at the sites, but they may be contacted by the land owners.
We need to operate quickly to ensure the traffickers can not get to the sites before us and remove the workers.
