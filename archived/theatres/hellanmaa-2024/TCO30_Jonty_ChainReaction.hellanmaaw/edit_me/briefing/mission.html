The UNA has been under constant attack by the Kardishev Front, with convoys travelling from the Hoopakka to the Heikkola FOBs frequently targeted and valuable assets, such as APCs, stolen during ambushes. In response to these attacks, the UNA has established an outpost near the area of conflict, which has provided critical intelligence that will guide the operation. The intelligence indicates the presence of Kardishev Front hideouts between the Hööpakka and Heikkola FOBs. These hideouts are strategically positioned to disrupt UNA operations and are connected by a network of communication towers. The UNA has been unable to directly engage in the dismantling of the main radio tower due to a complex web of political and logistical constraints. The main radio tower is located in a highly sensitive area, and any direct involvement by the UNA could escalate the situation and potentially draw unwanted attention from international observers. Additionally, the UNA's resources are stretched thin, with ongoing operations and the need to maintain a low profile to avoid drawing the ire of the Kardishev Front. Instead, the UNA has chosen to share its intelligence with Synixe contractors. The contractors are tasked with the delicate mission of infiltrating the area, disabling the main radio tower, and gathering the necessary information to neutralize the Kardishev Front's hideouts. Upon arrival at the UNA outpost, the contractors will find Colonel Jack Johnson, a seasoned veteran and key figure in the UNA's intelligence network. Colonel Johnson will brief the contractors on the intelligence they have gathered. The success of this mission is not just about dismantling the operations of the Kardishev Front; it's about maintaining the UNA's strategic advantage and ensuring the safety of their convoys.
