UNA forces, though dwindling, were doing a routine helicopter patrol in the region for scouting purposes. Upon getting to the northeast of their route, the helicopter produced a mayday call and went radio silent. The last known GPS signal is indicated by the BluFor Helicopter marking. It is believed that the helicopter was lost somewhere within the marked zone. The helicopter's last transmission was roughly two hours ago.

Synixe has been called upon to act as the quick reaction force. We have received a report looking for a total of ten (10) UNA military personnel. We are asked to bring them back dead or alive, with a preference of bringing them alive over dead. If they have been found deceased or fallen due to combat, they are asked to be brought back to be laid to rest for the final time.

The reports indicate that the helicopter had two (2) pilots, two (2) door gunners, and a fireteam consisting of six (6) members. 

Make sure to bring extra body bags, which will be provided for you in the equipment box by the front gate. 

Do note that it is 1500. It gets dark early in this part of the world, so be efficient before nightfall.
