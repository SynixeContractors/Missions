Following the successful retaliation by Synixe Contractors against the RSA last morning, enemy numbers have significantly dwindled. Intel gathered from the field indicated that the RSA border patrol has been retreating to fortify the northern town of Gvozdno. This allowed the CDF to capture the strategic town of Gorka during the hours after the last mission. Furthermore, CDF forces have successfully cleared the minefield and fortifications that were placed by the RSA, securing a safe passage for our troops and paving the way for further advances.

Synixe Contractors are tasked with dividing the two airfields in the north by capturing the towns between them and blocking the supply routes. This will severely limit the RSA's ability to coordinate and resupply their forces. The CDF will provide support during the mission by moving to take over the cleared areas, securing the flanks and rear. Refer to the notepad in Col. Petrovich's office for intel provided by CDF.
