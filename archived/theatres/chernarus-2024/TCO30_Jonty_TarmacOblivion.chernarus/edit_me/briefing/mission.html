The final objective in support of the CDF is the capture of Mikhail Volkov, a high-priority target currently believed to be in hiding at the northwestern airfield. Following a series of strategic setbacks, the majority of the Red Star Alliance (RSA) has consolidated its remaining forces at this location, transforming the airfield into a formidable stronghold. As a consequence, we anticipate encountering intense resistance, including the deployment of heavy armor assets.

The capture of Mikhail Volkov is of paramount importance, and his extraction must be conducted with the utmost care to ensure his survival. Volkov's apprehension will enable him to face trial for his culpability in inciting widespread violence, thereby bringing a measure of justice and accountability to the embattled region.

Synixe contractors are tasked with infiltrating the northwestern airfield, navigating through the heavily fortified defenses, and locating Mikhail Volkov. Once identified, contractors must utilize their expertise to subdue and extract Volkov, ensuring his safety and preventing any opportunities for escape. Additionally, neutralize or disable the RSA's heavy armor assets, thereby securing the airfield and facilitating a successful extraction. CDF regiments, stationed in the surrounding towns, will provide supporting reinforcements once Volkov's location is confirmed. Intelligence suggests a heightened patrol presence around the airfield perimeter.
