During the dead of night, stronghold NE intercepted suspicious radio chatter that was determined to be in the vicinity of the Black Forest. In response, a recon convoy was dispatched to patrol the area and pinpoint the exact location of the disturbance. Tragically, one of the recon vehicles triggered an IED and were ambushed by the RSA. The other vehicle nearly escaped and was subsequently returned to report the incident, revealing that the RSA had crossed the controlled border, exploiting the low patrol presence in this region.

Synixe contractors have been tasked to enter the contested zone, identify and clear out enemy encampments, and neutralize any threats to ensure the area is secure. The goal is to avenge the fallen and prevent any future incursions by the RSA.

Additionally, extra intelligence gathered by the CDF is available with Colonel Petrovich at the FOB. Contractors can talk to him before commencing the mission to obtain some crucial information which may provide valuable insights into the enemy's positions and strategies.
