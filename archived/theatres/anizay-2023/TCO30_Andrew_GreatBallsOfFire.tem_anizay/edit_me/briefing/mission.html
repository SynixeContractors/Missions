In the early parts of the morning, militants moved to the northern towns. They began shooting into homes and lighting them ablaze. We're anticipating it being the Anizay Freedom Insurgency. We are being called upon to act swiftly, moving into position as quick possible. Neutralize any threats and removing any civilians in distress from the AO.

The first report came from the city Ranagrezan several hours ago. We've received word that foot mobiles are moving east and possibly to Zarifkheyl. There is also a recent report of friendly United Assistance forces coming under fire when entering near Deraz. These are our main objective points. Do with this information as you must.
