The UNA were set to receive their scheduled air supply drop. As the delivery time approached, the helicopter pilots were heard sending a distress signal out. A scout saw the helicopter go down to the northern part of the yellow section from a watchtower. The pilots were recovered in the aftermath. The important delivery was not recovered and that's Synixe's tasking.

Go to the yellow area and search for a supply drop. Recover said drop and deliver it to FOB Nauzad. 

The pilots gave important information in that they believe the red circle area marked on your maps should be a potential AA site. It was not MANPAD related, so most likely will be something with AA guns.

The red area is not necessary to complete the mission, but could greatly benefit all friendly groups in the area and make the tasking today easier.
