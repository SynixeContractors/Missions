Contractors have been disrupting and destroying the AFI's operations, and AFI leadership is planning a large counter offensive to try to regain their lost control of the region. AFI forces are arriving from surrounding regions to join the offensive, and the AFI's top leadership will be present in our AO.

We need to disrupt the AFI's plan to organize a large force, and eliminate the AFI's leadership.

The leadership is likely hard to distinguish from the rest of their forces, but we expect them to be in the company of their most elite men and equipment.
