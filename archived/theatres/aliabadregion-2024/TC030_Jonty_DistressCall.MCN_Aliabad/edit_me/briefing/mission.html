A CIA observation post was established in the southwest region of Aliabad to monitor and counter the growing Taliban presence in the area. This strategic location was chosen to gather intelligence and maintain a watchful eye over the region's activities. However, a recent operation conducted by CIA officers and Takistani locals at night has unfortunately resulted in their capture. The operation was aimed at gathering further intelligence on the Taliban's movements and activities, but a critical mistake led to their capture. Before their capture, the leader of the operatives made a distress call to the CIA HQ, providing valuable information that has been instrumental in planning the extraction mission.

The situation has escalated, with UAV surveillance detecting high activity in the vicinity, indicating that the location is now completely occupied by Taliban forces. This development has heightened the urgency of the mission. Synixe contractors have been tasked with a critical mission: to secure the release of the captives and ensure their safe extraction. The mission not only involves securing the area but also safely transporting all personnel from the hideout to a designated CIA drop-off point which will be marked on the map once it is confirmed that all hostages are secured.
