Earlier today, a raid was conducted to capture and extract several HVTs from a remote compound south-east of Ahmad Golam.
We have three names:

- Saif Uallah
- Abdul-Bari
- Maryam Sayed

However, resistance faced during our raid proved far greater than we could handle. Our HVTs were able to escape in the confusion. The CIA isn't keen on losing this opportunity, but they do recognize the increased risk of going back in. So, all they're hoping to snatch is Saif Uallah.

Given how recently the raid occurred, it's very likely our targets are still within the local vicinity. The enemy's composition should be comprised of foot patrols and, at worst, motorized QRF. It might be worth searching the remote compound for any intel that was left behind, but UAV surveillance confirms an enemy QRF deployed on-site.
