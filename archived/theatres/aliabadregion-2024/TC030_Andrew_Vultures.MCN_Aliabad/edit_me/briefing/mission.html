CIA normally provides us with little to no information, unless prevelant to the task at hand. We are to go to the yellow circle marker to retrieve two backpacks and money. We are then tasked to deliver it to two Village Elders in two separate towns.
We have been informed that armed locals will be present. They are not the enemy... unless we make them our enemy. Split the money down the middle and provide each elder with half.

It seems the CIA are making efforts to buy their information or allegiance. Best we do not mess this up for the future of the region.
