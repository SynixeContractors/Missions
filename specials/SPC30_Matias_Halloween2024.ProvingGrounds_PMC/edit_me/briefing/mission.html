Recently an explosion was heard coming from a secret research facility belonging to an international corporation that works on anything from weapons to medicine.

The purpose of this taskforce is to move into the facility and investigate what happened. It is suspected that aside from working on weapons technology the facility was working with supernatural forces outside of their control.

You have been provided with a set of detectors that should be capable of detecting the byproduct of the forces that the facility was working with. Intelligence suggests that upon enetering the facility is an open area to store vehicles followed by the housing for the workers. What follows after that is unkown.

It is theorized that the facility employed heavy security forces that are well equipped, so thread carefully.

Good luck.
