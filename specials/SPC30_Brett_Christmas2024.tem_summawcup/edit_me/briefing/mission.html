Finland, along with other countries, have decided to join NATO.

As part of the negotiations that were made public, a backdoor deal was made with Canada.

The "Santa Claus Village" in Rovaniemi, Finland, has been brazenly spreading misinformation about Santa Claus.
Indoctrinating the youth of Finland to believe that Santa Claus is Finnish, and not Canadian, as the truth is.

As part of the deal, Finland has agreed to prevent the village from continuting to operate.
Finnish Police attempted to close the site peacefully, but were met with resistance.
A standoff has ensued.

On December 25th, 2024, Santa was doing his rounds, when he received anti-air fire from the village. A massive escalation to the conflict.

The Canadian Government is immediately deploying CANSOFCOM to assist in the operation to shut down the village.

Santa was able to expertly evade the fire and continue his mission, but several packages address to children fell from his sleigh.

It is up to JTF2 to remove the threat, eliminate their fake "Santa", secure the fortress, and deliver the packages to the children of Finland.
