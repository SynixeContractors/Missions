Santa Claus was done with his delivery of presents, and returned back to the North Pole.

NORAD had tracked his sleigh, but now that the deliveries were complete, operations had shut down for the year. His security detail had gone home to spend the days following Christmas with their families, their hard work and sacrifices appreciated but no longer needed.

The world had started to forget about Santa again, until next November when the stores would switch their playlists once again.

This was exactly what the Grinch had been waiting for. With Santa's security detail gone, with eyes turned away, it was the perfect time to strike.

Santa has been kidnapped. Secret demands have been made, and if they are not met, Santa's fate is uncertain.

Santa's elite security team, the Special Northern Operations Wing (SNOW), have been dispatched to rescue him. Negiotiates with the likes of the Grinch will not be entertained.
