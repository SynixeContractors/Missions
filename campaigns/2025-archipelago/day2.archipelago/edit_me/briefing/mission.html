We have been hired by Edward Fairchild, a British businessman interested in expanding his operations into the islands.

Mr. Fairchild has partnered with Lt. Molia, who has been working to remove corruption from the Gendarmerie and restore the rule of law to the islands.

Lt. Molia doesn't trust most of the Gendarmerie, and will secretly be working with us to root out corruption and fight off the criminal organization Te Manava Roa, that is responsible for much of the corruption and crime on the islands.
