The Wahat Nura Province of Takistan has been a hotbed of insurgent activity in recent months.

Virelia and the IEA are concerned about destabilization in the region, which could spill over into neighboring countries.

We have been hired by the IEA to assist in stabilizing the area, by advising the local Takistani forces, and conducting high value raids to dismantle insurgent operations.

Resupplies will be few and far between, so conserve your resources and plan accordingly.
